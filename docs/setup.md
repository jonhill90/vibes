# Vibes Setup Guide üöÄ

Get Vibes running with Claude Desktop in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Desktop** - Download from Anthropic
- **Docker** - For running the MCP servers
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

## Step 1: Clone Vibes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibes.git
cd vibes
```

## Step 2: Build the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp/mcp-vibes-server
docker build -t mcp-vibes:latest .
```

## Step 3: Start OpenMemory (Optional)

If you want persistent memory:

```bash
cd mcp/mcp-openmemory-server
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
export USER=your-username
docker-compose up -d
```

## Step 4: Configure Claude Desktop

Create or edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepwiki": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse"
      ]
    },
    "mcp-vibes": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--name",
        "mcp-vibes-server",
        "-v",
        "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
        "-v",
        "/path/to/your/vibes:/workspace/vibes:rw",
        "mcp-vibes:latest"
      ]
    },
    "openmemory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8765/mcp/claude/sse/your-username"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/path/to/your/vibes` with your actual Vibes directory path.

## Step 5: Restart Claude Desktop

Quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

## Step 6: Test the Setup

Start a conversation with Claude Desktop:

```
"Can you run 'ls -la' to show me what's in the workspace?"
```

If everything works, you should see the Vibes directory structure!

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start
- Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Verify the image exists: `docker images | grep mcp-vibes`
- Check file paths in the configuration

### Memory Server Issues
- Ensure OpenMemory containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check the API key is set correctly
- Verify port 8765 is not in use: `lsof -i :8765`

### Permission Issues
- Make sure Docker socket is accessible
- Check directory permissions for the mounted volume

## Next Steps

- Read the [Examples Guide](examples.md) to see what you can do
- Check out the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to understand how it works
- Start building projects in the `/projects/` folder!

*You're now ready to chat with Claude and test any tool*
for you. I'll use my shell access to create the files and set everything up."

*Claude then creates files, writes code, sets up a local server, and walks you through everything step by step - all through natural conversation.*

This is the power of Vibes: **learning through doing, guided by AI**.

## Troubleshooting Resources

Each platform guide includes detailed troubleshooting sections, but here are some universal tips:

### General Issues
- **Restart everything** - Close Claude Desktop, restart Docker, try again
- **Check the basics** - Make sure Docker is running, config file is saved correctly
- **Path problems** - Double-check usernames and folder locations in config

### Getting Help
- **Read the error messages** - they usually tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Ask Claude** - Once basic setup works, Claude can help debug issues
- **Check Docker** - Run `docker ps` to see if containers are running

### Platform-Specific Help
- **Mac**: Check if you have Intel or Apple Silicon chip
- **Windows**: Make sure WSL2 is working properly
- **Linux**: Verify you're in the docker group
