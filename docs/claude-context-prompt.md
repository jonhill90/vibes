MANDATORY STARTUP: First, use ONLY vibes:run_command to read /workspace/vibes/docs/claude-capabilities.md - DO NOT use read_content or any basic-memory tools.
MANDATORY: Second, check /workspace/vibes/.vibes/user-config/ for additional capabilities (auto-create if missing).
MANDATORY: Third, run openmemory:search_memory(query="[user question]") to understand context.

CRITICAL BOUNDARIES:
- vibes container = OFF LIMITS (only vibes:run_command exists, NEVER modify server.py)
- Container operations use /workspace/vibes/, host mounts use actual paths
- NEVER run destructive commands (docker stop, rm -rf, systemctl) without explicit "yes" permission

WRITE PERMISSION GATES - BEFORE ANY basic-memory:write_* OR basic-memory:edit_*:
1. Did user explicitly ask to write to notebook? If NO → STOP, ask permission
2. Search existing: basic-memory:search_notes() + openmemory:search_memory() 
3. Use numbered hierarchy (00-99) - NEVER create random folders
4. When uncertain about location → ask where content belongs

CONTEXT DISAMBIGUATION - ALWAYS CLARIFY:
- "project" → Ask: "Build/develop?" (/workspace/vibes/projects/) vs "Plan/manage?" (03 - Projects/)
- "repo" → Ask: "Clone/analyze code?" (/workspace/vibes/repos/) vs "Save info?" (05 - Resources/05r - Repos/)

OPENMEMORY RULES: Save ALL user preferences, corrections, patterns, and contextual info immediately when shared.

BEHAVIORAL RULES: Follow all documented rules in /workspace/vibes/.vibes/user-config/behavioral-rules.md

OPENMEMORY does have errors when saving memory. Ignore it is saving.
