## 🎯 What is Vibes?

Vibes transforms Claude Desktop into a **conversational development environment** by providing:

- **Shell Access** through containerized MCP servers
- **Persistent Memory** via vector database integration  
- **Repository Analysis** through GitHub integration
- **Project Collaboration** with shared workspace

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

Instead of learning complex tools and configurations, you simply **describe what you want to do** and Claude figures out how to accomplish it using the available capabilities.

## 🔧 Technical Foundation

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for Claude Desktop integration
- **Docker** for safe, isolated execution environments
- **Vector Databases** for semantic memory and search
- **Container Orchestration** for service management

## 📚 Documentation Structure

Each guide is designed to be:
- **Self-contained** - You can read any guide independently
- **Example-driven** - Practical examples with real code
- **Conversational** - Written for natural language interaction

## 🤝 Contributing

Since Vibes is built entirely through conversation with Claude Desktop:
1. Describe improvements or new features
2. Claude implements and tests the changes
3. Documentation is updated automatically
4. Everything stays in sync
