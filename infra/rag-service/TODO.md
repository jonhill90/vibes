# RAG Service - Current Status & Action Items

## ✅ FIXED: Cache Volume Mount Configuration (2025-10-16 20:15)

**Problem Solved**: Container disk space exhaustion (was 100% full)
- Root cause: ML models downloading into container overlay filesystem
- Cache breakdown: HuggingFace (1GB) + Playwright (895MB) + Pip (28MB) = ~2GB

**Solution Implemented**: Unified cache volume mount
- ✅ Added `APP_CACHE_DIR` to `.env` with Option A (relative) and Option B (absolute) documented
- ✅ Updated `docker-compose.yml` to mount `/root/.cache` to `${APP_CACHE_DIR:-./cache}`
- ✅ Created `.gitignore` to exclude cache directory from version control

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - backend service
volumes:
  - ${APP_CACHE_DIR:-./cache}:/root/.cache  # All caches persisted
```

```bash
# .env - Default (Option A)
APP_CACHE_DIR=./cache

# .env - Alternative (Option B) - Uncomment to use
# APP_CACHE_DIR=/Users/jon/.cache/rag-service
```

**Next Step**: Restart services to apply volume mount
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
# Cache will persist across restarts, models download once
```

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025-10-16)

### 1. Cascade Delete with Qdrant Cleanup - FULLY FIXED
- ✅ Implemented atomic deletion from both PostgreSQL and Qdrant
- ✅ Fixed `chunk_id` → `id` column name bug (chunks table schema)
- ✅ Added OpenAI client to app.state for document ingestion
- ✅ All 21 DocumentService unit tests passing
- ✅ Delete endpoint tested and working (no orphaned vectors)

**Implementation**:
- `backend/src/services/document_service.py:369` - Fixed column name
- `backend/src/main.py:92-102` - Added OpenAI client initialization
- Deletion flow: Query chunk IDs → Delete from Qdrant → Delete from PostgreSQL
- If Qdrant fails, PostgreSQL deletion is aborted (atomic operation)

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ 28/28 file upload validation tests passing
- ✅ 21/21 DocumentService unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests ready (document API, search API, cascade deletes)
- ✅ Test fixtures and conftest.py properly configured
- ✅ Documentation: README.md, tests/README.md, validation reports

### 3. Frontend Delete Functionality
- ✅ Sources: Delete button with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Crawl jobs: Delete button with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Documents: Complete DocumentsManagement.tsx component (699 lines)
- ✅ API client: deleteCrawlJob() and deleteDocument() functions
- ✅ All delete operations use modal confirmations

### 4. Web Crawling Performance Fix
- ✅ Fixed Qdrant timeout issue (5s → 60s)
- ✅ Implemented batch upserts (100 chunks per batch)
- ✅ Successfully ingested 1,225 chunks from Pydantic AI docs
- ✅ Verified search functionality working with crawled content

---

## 📋 Active Issues

### OpenAI API Key Issue
- Current API key returns 401 authentication error
- This is a deployment/configuration issue, not a code issue
- Document upload will fail at embedding stage until key is updated
- **Action**: Update `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` with valid key

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Test Document Upload (Priority: CRITICAL)
- [x] Add cache volume mount to docker-compose.yml ✅
- [x] Add `APP_CACHE_DIR` to .env ✅
- [x] Create .gitignore for cache directory ✅
- [ ] **ACTION REQUIRED**: Restart services (`docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`)
- [ ] Update OpenAI API key in .env (current key returns 401 error)
- [ ] Test document upload end-to-end with valid API key
- [ ] Verify cache persistence (models downloaded once, reused on restart)

### 2. Architecture Decision: Single vs Multi-Collection (Priority: HIGH)
**Current**: Single Qdrant collection for all sources (metadata filtering)
**Context**: Greenfield project, planning to ingest large amounts of data

**Evaluate**:
- Keep single collection (simpler, cross-domain search)
- Switch to collection-per-source (isolation, per-domain optimization)
- Hybrid approach (general + sensitive collections)

**Decision criteria**:
- Expected total vector count across all sources
- Need for multi-tenancy or domain isolation
- Different embedding models per domain?
- Compliance/security requirements?

### 3. Run Integration Tests (Priority: MEDIUM)
Once disk space issue is fixed:
- [ ] Run document API integration tests
- [ ] Run search API integration tests
- [ ] Run cascade delete integration tests
- [ ] Run browser tests (upload, search, delete)
- [ ] Target: 80%+ code coverage

### 4. Production Readiness (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Add volume mounts for temp file storage (document uploads)
- [ ] Configure log rotation for backend logs
- [ ] Add monitoring/metrics endpoints
- [ ] Document deployment guide for production

## 📊 System Health

**Working Features**:
- ✅ Source management (create, list, update, delete)
- ✅ Web crawling with Crawl4AI + Playwright
- ✅ Vector search with source filtering
- ✅ Document deletion with Qdrant cleanup
- ✅ Frontend UI for all core operations

**Known Limitations**:
- ❌ Document upload fails (disk space + invalid API key)
- ⚠️ Container disk: 100% full (needs cleanup or volume mount)
- ⚠️ OpenAI API key invalid (401 authentication error)

**Current Data**:
- Sources: 1 (Pydantic AI Documentation)
- Documents: ~multiple pages from crawl
- Chunks: 1,225 in Qdrant
- Vectors: 1,225 in "documents" collection

---

## 📝 Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single Qdrant Collection**: All sources use one "documents" collection
  - Filtering via metadata (source_id field)
  - Enables cross-domain search by default
  - Simple management, efficient for current scale
  - Reconsider if: multi-tenancy, different embedding models, or >500K vectors

- **Source = Domain of Knowledge**: Mental model for organizing documents
  - Each source represents a coherent body of knowledge
  - Examples: "AWS Docs", "React Docs", "Internal Wiki"
  - Enable semantic filtering: "Search only AWS docs"

### Critical Gotchas Fixed
- ✅ Gotcha #2: Store db_pool, not connections (all services)
- ✅ Gotcha #3: Use $1, $2 placeholders, not %s (asyncpg)
- ✅ Gotcha #8: CORS with specific origins, not ["*"]
- ✅ Gotcha #9: HNSW disabled (m=0) for bulk upload (60-90x faster)
- ✅ Gotcha #12: async with pool.acquire() for connections

### Database Schema
```
sources (id, source_type, url, status, metadata)
  └── documents (id, source_id, title, document_type, url)
       └── chunks (id, document_id, chunk_index, text)
            └── vectors in Qdrant (point_id = chunk.id, payload includes source_id)
```

### Cascade Deletion
- Deleting source → CASCADE deletes documents, chunks, crawl_jobs (PostgreSQL)
- Deleting document → Atomic: Qdrant cleanup → PostgreSQL CASCADE to chunks
- Ensures no orphaned data in either database
