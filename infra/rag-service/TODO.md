# RAG Service Status

## All Fixed ✅

### Backend
- Crawl endpoint metadata parsing (json.dumps in POST, json.loads in GET)
- Playwright browsers installed (chromium 175MB)
- Playwright system dependencies installed (97 packages)
- Web crawling working with Crawl4AI + Playwright

### Frontend
- API baseURL runtime detection (localhost for Mac, host.docker.internal for Docker)
- All React null safety issues resolved
- Search endpoint working (200 OK, no 400 errors)

### Networking
- Mac browser → localhost:8003 (backend) ✅
- Mac browser → localhost:5173 (frontend) ✅
- Docker browser → host.docker.internal:8003 (backend) ✅
- Docker browser → host.docker.internal:5173 (frontend) ✅

## Fully Working Features ✅
1. **Sources Management**: Create, list, view sources
2. **Crawl Jobs**: Start crawls, monitor status, view completed/failed jobs
3. **Search**: Vector search with 0ms response on empty corpus
4. **Web Crawling**: Successfully crawled https://httpbin.org/html (1 page)

## Notes
- Crawl4AI uses Playwright internally (not a separate crawler)
- Old failed crawls visible in history (before Playwright installation)
- New crawls work correctly with Playwright browsers installed
