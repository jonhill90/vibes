# RAG Service Status

## All Fixed ‚úÖ

### Backend
- Crawl endpoint metadata parsing (json.dumps in POST, json.loads in GET)
- Playwright browsers installed (chromium 175MB)
- Playwright system dependencies installed (97 packages)
- Web crawling working with Crawl4AI + Playwright

### Frontend
- API baseURL runtime detection (localhost for Mac, host.docker.internal for Docker)
- All React null safety issues resolved
- Search endpoint working (200 OK, no 400 errors)

### Networking
- Mac browser ‚Üí localhost:8003 (backend) ‚úÖ
- Mac browser ‚Üí localhost:5173 (frontend) ‚úÖ
- Docker browser ‚Üí host.docker.internal:8003 (backend) ‚úÖ
- Docker browser ‚Üí host.docker.internal:5173 (frontend) ‚úÖ

## Fully Working Features ‚úÖ
1. **Sources Management**: Create, list, view sources
2. **Crawl Jobs**: Start crawls, monitor status, view completed/failed jobs
3. **Search**: Vector search with 0ms response on empty corpus
4. **Web Crawling**: Successfully crawled https://httpbin.org/html (1 page)

## Current Issues to Fix

### 1. Duplicate Crawl Jobs Created ‚úÖ FIXED & VERIFIED
- Starting a crawl WAS creating 2 jobs: one completes, one stays pending
- NOT double-click - different IDs, one had recursive:true
- ROOT CAUSE: crawls.py:220 created job, then ingestion_service‚Üícrawl_website created ANOTHER
- FIX APPLIED: Removed job creation from crawls.py, extract job_id from crawl_result
- Changed: backend/src/api/routes/crawls.py (removed duplicate INSERT, extract from result)
- TESTED ‚úÖ: New crawl creates only 1 job (6f4659b6-6a7e), status=completed
- Old crawls in DB show duplicate pattern (confirming bug existed before fix)

### 2. Documents Not Visible After Upload
- Upload succeeds but documents don't appear
- Need: Check if chunks are being created and stored in Qdrant
- Need: Verify document listing endpoint

### 3. Search Filter Not Working
- Source dropdown filter doesn't filter results
- Need: Check if source_id parameter is being passed correctly

### 4. No Delete Functionality ‚úÖ FIXED (Backend), üî¥ TODO (Frontend)
- ‚úÖ DELETE /api/crawls/{job_id} - implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ DELETE /api/documents/{document_id} - already existed
- ‚úÖ DELETE /api/sources/{source_id} - already existed (CASCADE deletes docs/chunks)
- üî¥ **Frontend TODO**: Add delete buttons in UI
  - Sources page: Delete button for each source (with confirmation dialog)
  - Crawl jobs page: Delete button for each crawl job
  - Documents page: Delete button for each document
  - Use confirmation modal before deletion (prevent accidents)
  - Show success/error toasts after deletion
  - Refresh list after successful deletion

### 5. Data Storage Verification
- Need to confirm: Chunks going to Qdrant vector DB ‚úì
- Need to confirm: Documents going to PostgreSQL
- Need to confirm: Search querying Qdrant properly

### 6. Web Crawl Content Truncation üî¥ STILL AN ISSUE
- ‚úÖ Removed 100K char truncation in crawl_service.py:159
- ‚ùå Still only getting ~50 chunks from 2.7MB Pydantic AI docs (expected 300-400)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Crawl4AI library itself returns truncated markdown
  - `result.markdown` from Crawl4AI is already truncated before our code sees it
  - Issue is in Crawl4AI AsyncWebCrawler, not our wrapper code
- **Investigation needed**:
  - Check Crawl4AI configuration options for content length limits
  - May need to use Crawl4AI's chunking strategy instead of post-processing
  - Consider alternative: Use Crawl4AI's LLM extraction mode for large docs
- Location: backend/src/services/crawler/crawl_service.py line 155-169
- Test case: https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms-full.txt (2.7MB ‚Üí ~50 chunks instead of 300-400)

## Notes
- Crawl4AI uses Playwright internally (not a separate crawler)
- Old failed crawls visible in history (before Playwright installation)
- New crawls work correctly with Playwright browsers installed
- Crawled content IS going to Qdrant (user confirmed)
- Pydantic AI crawl verified working but truncated at 100K chars
