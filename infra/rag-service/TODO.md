# RAG Service Status

## All Fixed ✅

### Backend
- Crawl endpoint metadata parsing (json.dumps in POST, json.loads in GET)
- Playwright browsers installed (chromium 175MB)
- Playwright system dependencies installed (97 packages)
- Web crawling working with Crawl4AI + Playwright

### Frontend
- API baseURL runtime detection (localhost for Mac, host.docker.internal for Docker)
- All React null safety issues resolved
- Search endpoint working (200 OK, no 400 errors)

### Networking
- Mac browser → localhost:8003 (backend) ✅
- Mac browser → localhost:5173 (frontend) ✅
- Docker browser → host.docker.internal:8003 (backend) ✅
- Docker browser → host.docker.internal:5173 (frontend) ✅

## Fully Working Features ✅
1. **Sources Management**: Create, list, view sources
2. **Crawl Jobs**: Start crawls, monitor status, view completed/failed jobs
3. **Search**: Vector search with 0ms response on empty corpus
4. **Web Crawling**: Successfully crawled https://httpbin.org/html (1 page)

## Current Issues to Fix

### 1. Duplicate Crawl Jobs Created ✅ FIXED & VERIFIED
- Starting a crawl WAS creating 2 jobs: one completes, one stays pending
- NOT double-click - different IDs, one had recursive:true
- ROOT CAUSE: crawls.py:220 created job, then ingestion_service→crawl_website created ANOTHER
- FIX APPLIED: Removed job creation from crawls.py, extract job_id from crawl_result
- Changed: backend/src/api/routes/crawls.py (removed duplicate INSERT, extract from result)
- TESTED ✅: New crawl creates only 1 job (6f4659b6-6a7e), status=completed
- Old crawls in DB show duplicate pattern (confirming bug existed before fix)

### 2. Documents Not Visible After Upload
- Upload succeeds but documents don't appear
- Need: Check if chunks are being created and stored in Qdrant
- Need: Verify document listing endpoint

### 3. Search Filter Not Working
- Source dropdown filter doesn't filter results
- Need: Check if source_id parameter is being passed correctly

### 4. No Delete Functionality
- Cannot delete crawl jobs
- Cannot delete documents
- Cannot delete sources
- Need: Add DELETE endpoints and UI buttons

### 5. Data Storage Verification
- Need to confirm: Chunks going to Qdrant vector DB ✓
- Need to confirm: Documents going to PostgreSQL
- Need to confirm: Search querying Qdrant properly

## Notes
- Crawl4AI uses Playwright internally (not a separate crawler)
- Old failed crawls visible in history (before Playwright installation)
- New crawls work correctly with Playwright browsers installed
- Crawled content IS going to Qdrant (user confirmed)
