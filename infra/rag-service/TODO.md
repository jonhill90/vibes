# RAG Service Status

## Recent Progress (2025-10-16)

### Completed Today ‚úÖ

#### Earlier Work
1. **Document Upload Ingestion Pipeline** - Fixed the critical bug where uploaded documents weren't being processed
   - Wired up full ingestion pipeline to upload endpoint (backend/src/api/routes/documents.py:174-283)
   - Documents now: save to temp file ‚Üí parse ‚Üí chunk ‚Üí embed ‚Üí store in PostgreSQL + Qdrant
   - Added chunk_count in upload response
   - Files cleaned up after processing

2. **Search Source Filtering** - Verified implementation is correct
   - Frontend properly passes source_id filter (SearchInterface.tsx:82)
   - Backend correctly applies filter to Qdrant search (search.py:165-166)
   - Ready for testing with actual data

3. **Frontend Delete Functionality** - Added delete buttons with confirmation dialogs
   - CrawlManagement: Delete button for completed/failed/cancelled crawl jobs (CrawlManagement.tsx:349-454)
   - API client: Added deleteCrawlJob() and deleteDocument() functions (client.ts:271-282)
   - SourceManagement: Already had delete functionality with confirmation dialog
   - All use modal confirmations to prevent accidental deletions

#### Testing Infrastructure (PRP: rag_service_testing_validation)
4. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - DocumentService tests FIXED ‚úÖ

   **Tasks Completed (10/10 implementation tasks)**:
   - ‚úÖ Task 1: Extended test fixtures (conftest.py)
   - ‚úÖ Task 2: File upload validation tests (28 tests - ALL PASSING)
   - ‚úÖ Task 3: Document service tests (21/21 PASSING - 100% ‚úÖ)
   - ‚úÖ Task 4: Document API integration tests (15 tests - ready to run)
   - ‚úÖ Task 5: Search API integration tests (8 tests - ready to run)
   - ‚úÖ Task 6: Cascade delete tests (6 tests - ready to run)
   - ‚úÖ Task 7: Browser upload test (documented workflow)
   - ‚úÖ Task 8: Browser search filtering test (documented workflow)
   - ‚úÖ Task 9: Browser delete operations test (documented workflow)
   - ‚úÖ Task 10: DocumentsManagement.tsx component (699 lines)

   **Recent Fix (2025-10-16 18:37)**:
   - ‚úÖ Fixed async context manager mocking in conftest.py
     - Changed from async generator to proper `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` pattern
     - `__aexit__` must return `False` to not suppress exceptions
     - Created `setup_mock_connection()` helper for consistent mock setup
   - ‚úÖ Fixed error handling scope in DocumentService
     - Moved return statements inside `async with` blocks
     - Fixed `UnboundLocalError` when exceptions occurred
     - Applied to both `create_document()` and `delete_document()` methods
   - **Result**: DocumentService tests went from 17 failed ‚Üí 21 passed (100%)

   **Test Results Summary**:
   - ‚úÖ **File Validation Tests**: 28/28 PASSED (100%)
   - ‚úÖ **Document Service Tests**: 21/21 PASSED (100%) üéâ
   - ‚úÖ **Linting**: Ruff 0 violations
   - ‚úÖ **Syntax**: All test files compile without errors
   - üîÑ **Unit Tests Overall**: 49/101 PASSED ‚Üí Need to run other unit test files
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Coverage**: 32.38% (below 80% target)

   **What Works**:
   - ‚úÖ Test framework fully configured (pytest, ruff installed in Docker)
   - ‚úÖ File upload validation tests (28/28 passing)
   - ‚úÖ DocumentService unit tests (21/21 passing - fixed async mocking)
   - ‚úÖ DocumentsManagement.tsx component created with delete modal
   - ‚úÖ All test files syntactically valid
   - ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (README, tests/README, validation-report, execution-summary)

   **What Needs Work**:
   - Run integration tests (document API, search API, cascade deletes)
   - Run browser tests (requires services running + Playwright browser binaries)
   - Increase coverage from 32% to 80%+ target

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - ‚úÖ README.md: Added comprehensive testing section with quality gate levels
   - ‚úÖ tests/README.md: Created detailed testing guide (fixtures, running tests, troubleshooting)
   - ‚úÖ Execution reports: 10 task completion reports + execution plan + validation report + summary

### Next Steps üîÑ

**Available Options**:
- ~~**Option A**: Fix the failing tests by aligning mocks with actual DocumentService API~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED (21/21 passing)
- **Option B**: Create the missing DocumentsManagement.tsx frontend component with list and delete functionality
- **Option C**: Investigate the Crawl4AI content truncation issue (currently only getting ~50 chunks from 2.7MB docs)
- **Option D**: Run the integration and browser tests to validate the end-to-end functionality
  - Integration tests: document API, search API, cascade deletes
  - Browser tests: Upload, search filtering, delete operations

## All Fixed ‚úÖ

### Backend
- Crawl endpoint metadata parsing (json.dumps in POST, json.loads in GET)
- Playwright browsers installed (chromium 175MB)
- Playwright system dependencies installed (97 packages)
- Web crawling working with Crawl4AI + Playwright

### Frontend
- API baseURL runtime detection (localhost for Mac, host.docker.internal for Docker)
- All React null safety issues resolved
- Search endpoint working (200 OK, no 400 errors)

### Networking
- Mac browser ‚Üí localhost:8003 (backend) ‚úÖ
- Mac browser ‚Üí localhost:5173 (frontend) ‚úÖ
- Docker browser ‚Üí host.docker.internal:8003 (backend) ‚úÖ
- Docker browser ‚Üí host.docker.internal:5173 (frontend) ‚úÖ

## Fully Working Features ‚úÖ
1. **Sources Management**: Create, list, view sources
2. **Crawl Jobs**: Start crawls, monitor status, view completed/failed jobs
3. **Search**: Vector search with 0ms response on empty corpus
4. **Web Crawling**: Successfully crawled https://httpbin.org/html (1 page)

## Screenshots

- crawl-working.png: Successful crawl completion

## Current Issues to Fix

### 1. Duplicate Crawl Jobs Created ‚úÖ FIXED & VERIFIED
- Starting a crawl WAS creating 2 jobs: one completes, one stays pending
- NOT double-click - different IDs, one had recursive:true
- ROOT CAUSE: crawls.py:220 created job, then ingestion_service‚Üícrawl_website created ANOTHER
- FIX APPLIED: Removed job creation from crawls.py, extract job_id from crawl_result
- Changed: backend/src/api/routes/crawls.py (removed duplicate INSERT, extract from result)
- TESTED ‚úÖ: New crawl creates only 1 job (6f4659b6-6a7e), status=completed
- Old crawls in DB show duplicate pattern (confirming bug existed before fix)

### 2. Documents Not Visible After Upload ‚öôÔ∏è IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ Root cause identified: Ingestion pipeline not wired to upload endpoint (line 175 TODO)
- ‚úÖ Implemented full ingestion pipeline in upload endpoint:
  - Saves uploaded file to temp location
  - Initializes all required services (DocumentParser, TextChunker, EmbeddingService, VectorService)
  - Runs full ingest_document() pipeline (parse ‚Üí chunk ‚Üí embed ‚Üí store)
  - Cleans up temp file after processing
  - Returns chunk_count in response
- üîÑ Testing needed: Upload a document and verify chunks appear in database/Qdrant
- Location: backend/src/api/routes/documents.py:174-283

### 3. Search Filter Not Working ‚úÖ LIKELY FIXED
- ‚úÖ Frontend correctly handles source filter (SearchInterface.tsx:152-154)
- ‚úÖ API client passes source_id parameter (SearchInterface.tsx:82)
- ‚úÖ Backend correctly builds filters dict (search.py:165-166)
- Implementation appears correct - may need testing with actual data to confirm
- If issue persists, check Qdrant filter syntax in vector_service.py

### 4. No Delete Functionality ‚úÖ MOSTLY FIXED
- ‚úÖ DELETE /api/crawls/{job_id} - backend implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ DELETE /api/documents/{document_id} - backend already existed
- ‚úÖ DELETE /api/sources/{source_id} - backend already existed (CASCADE deletes docs/chunks)
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Added delete functionality to UI components
  - ‚úÖ Sources page: Delete button with confirmation dialog (SourceManagement.tsx:266-306) - ALREADY EXISTED
  - ‚úÖ Crawl jobs page: Added delete button with confirmation dialog (CrawlManagement.tsx:349-454)
  - ‚úÖ API client: Added deleteCrawlJob() and deleteDocument() functions (client.ts:271-282)
  - üî¥ **TODO**: Create "Manage Documents" page component with list and delete functionality
  - All delete operations use confirmation modals and refresh lists after success

### 5. Data Storage Verification
- Need to confirm: Chunks going to Qdrant vector DB ‚úì
- Need to confirm: Documents going to PostgreSQL
- Need to confirm: Search querying Qdrant properly

### 6. Web Crawl Content Truncation üî¥ STILL AN ISSUE
- ‚úÖ Removed 100K char truncation in crawl_service.py:159
- ‚ùå Still only getting ~50 chunks from 2.7MB Pydantic AI docs (expected 300-400)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Crawl4AI library itself returns truncated markdown
  - `result.markdown` from Crawl4AI is already truncated before our code sees it
  - Issue is in Crawl4AI AsyncWebCrawler, not our wrapper code
- **Investigation needed**:
  - Check Crawl4AI configuration options for content length limits
  - May need to use Crawl4AI's chunking strategy instead of post-processing
  - Consider alternative: Use Crawl4AI's LLM extraction mode for large docs
- Location: backend/src/services/crawler/crawl_service.py line 155-169
- Test case: https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms-full.txt (2.7MB ‚Üí ~50 chunks instead of 300-400)

## Notes
- Crawl4AI uses Playwright internally (not a separate crawler)
- Old failed crawls visible in history (before Playwright installation)
- New crawls work correctly with Playwright browsers installed
- Crawled content IS going to Qdrant (user confirmed)
- Pydantic AI crawl verified working but truncated at 100K chars
