"""
Cleanup Legacy Qdrant Collections

Removes old shared collections (AI_DOCUMENTS, AI_CODE, AI_MEDIA) that were replaced
by per-domain collections in the per_domain_collections migration.

Per-domain collections follow the pattern: {source_title}_{collection_type}
Example: DevOps_Knowledge_documents, AI_Knowledge_code

This script safely removes only the legacy global collections.
