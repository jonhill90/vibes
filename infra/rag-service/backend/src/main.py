"""FastAPI application for RAG Service.

This is the main entry point for the RAG Service backend API.
Provides RESTful endpoints for document ingestion, vector search, and RAG operations
with proper CORS configuration and database lifecycle management.

KEY FEATURES:
- Environment-specific CORS configuration (Gotcha #8)
- Database connection pool lifecycle management (Gotcha #2)
- Qdrant client initialization and cleanup
- Qdrant collection initialization with HNSW disabled for bulk upload (Gotcha #9)
- Health check endpoint
- OpenAPI documentation with metadata
- API router organization with /api prefix

CRITICAL GOTCHAS ADDRESSED:
- Gotcha #2: Returns POOL from dependencies, NOT connections
- Gotcha #8: CORS configured with specific origins (NEVER allow_origins=["*"])
- Gotcha #9: HNSW disabled (m=0) during bulk upload for 60-90x speedup
- Gotcha #12: Services use async with pool.acquire() for connection management
