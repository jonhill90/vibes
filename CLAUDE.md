### Key Components

**MCP Servers**
- `mcp-vibesbox-server`: Python-based MCP server providing shell execution and VNC-based GUI automation capabilities
  - Runs commands in containerized environments with visual feedback
  - Takes screenshots and saves them to `/workspace/vibes/screenshots/`
  - Uses ImageMagick for screenshot capture
  - Exposes tools: `run_command`, GUI automation tools
  - Docker-based with systemd, privileged mode, VNC on port 5901

**PRP System (Product Requirements Prompt)**
- Context engineering methodology: PRP = PRD + Curated Codebase Intelligence + Agent Runbook
- Transforms AI coding from generic code generation to production-ready implementation
- Core principles: Context is King, Validation Loops, Information Dense, Progressive Success
- PRPs include: Goal/Why/What (PRD), full context (docs, files, gotchas, codebase intelligence), implementation blueprint (agent runbook), validation gates
- Treats Claude as a developer requiring comprehensive briefing with specific, logical instructions
- Use `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` to research and create PRPs
- Use `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` to implement with iterative validation

**Claude Agents**
- `documentation-manager`: Proactively updates docs when code changes (tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob, ls)
- `validation-gates`: Runs tests, validates changes, iterates on fixes until passing (tools: Bash, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite)

## Common Development Workflows

### Working with PRPs

**Create a new PRP:**
```bash
# Use the generate-prp command in Claude Code
/generate-prp <feature-description>
```
This researches the codebase, gathers context, and creates a comprehensive PRP in `prps/<feature-name>.md`

**Execute a PRP:**
```bash
# Use the execute-prp command
/execute-prp prps/<feature-name>.md
```
This implements the feature following the PRP's validation loops and quality gates.

### Working with MCP Servers

**Start the vibesbox server:**
```bash
cd mcp/mcp-vibesbox-server
docker-compose up -d
```

**Access VNC:**
- Port 5901 exposed for VNC connections
- Display: `:1`

**Monitor web UI:**
```bash
cd mcp/mcp-vibesbox-monitor/web
npm start  # Starts on port 3000, proxies to backend on 8000
```

### Using Claude Agents

The codebase has two specialized agents configured:

1. **After code changes**, the `documentation-manager` agent should be called to update relevant docs
2. **After implementing features**, the `validation-gates` agent should validate all tests pass

## INITIAL.md Factory Workflow

### Overview

Multi-subagent system for creating comprehensive INITIAL.md files that feed into the PRP generation process. This workflow automates requirements gathering through systematic research, reducing creation time from 30+ minutes to <10 minutes.

**Key Innovation**: 6 specialized subagents with separate context windows running in parallel conduct comprehensive research without context pollution, then synthesize into a single production-ready INITIAL.md.

### When to Use This Workflow

✅ **Trigger this workflow when user says ANY of these**:
- "Help me create INITIAL.md for [feature]"
- "I need to build INITIAL.md for [feature]"
- "Create INITIAL.md for [feature]"
- "Generate INITIAL requirements for [feature]"
- "Write INITIAL.md for [feature]"
- "I want to make an INITIAL.md for [feature]"

❌ **Don't use this workflow for**:
- Executing/implementing existing INITIAL.md (use `/execute-prp` instead)
- Generating PRP from existing INITIAL.md (use `/generate-prp` instead)

### Immediate Recognition Actions

When you detect an INITIAL.md creation request:

1. ✅ **STOP** any other work immediately
2. ✅ **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "I'll help create a comprehensive INITIAL.md using the factory workflow"
3. ✅ **PROCEED** to Phase 0 (don't ask for permission)
4. ✅ **NEVER** skip Phase 0 clarifications
5. ✅ **NEVER** try to write INITIAL.md directly

### The 5-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 0: Recognition & Basic Clarification

**Who handles this**: YOU (main Claude Code)
**Time**: 2-3 minutes (includes user response wait)

**Your Actions**:
1. Ask 2-3 clarifying questions:
   - Primary use case: What problem does this solve?
   - Technical preferences: Specific technologies or recommend?
   - Integration needs: Any existing systems to integrate?

2. ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: WAIT for user response - DO NOT PROCEED

3. After user responds:
   - Determine feature name (snake_case)
   - Create directories: `prps/research/`, `examples/{feature}/`
   - Check Archon: `health_check()`
   - Create Archon project and 6 tasks if available
   - Proceed to Phase 1

#### Phase 1: Deep Feature Analysis

**Subagent**: `prp-initial-feature-clarifier`
**Time**: 2-3 minutes
**Mode**: AUTONOMOUS

**What it does**:
- Searches Archon for similar features
- Decomposes request into requirements
- Makes intelligent assumptions
- Documents assumptions clearly
- Creates `prps/research/feature-analysis.md`

#### Phase 2: Parallel Research (CRITICAL PHASE)

**Subagents**: THREE simultaneously
- `prp-initial-codebase-researcher`
- `prp-initial-documentation-hunter`
- `prp-initial-example-curator`

**Time**: 3-5 minutes (all run in parallel)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Invoke all three in SINGLE message using parallel tool invocation

**What each does**:
- **Codebase**: Searches Archon + local code for patterns → `codebase-patterns.md`
- **Documentation**: Checks Archon, then WebSearch for official docs → `documentation-links.md`
- **Examples**: EXTRACTS code to `examples/{feature}/` directory → `examples-to-include.md` + code files

**Expected Outputs**:
- `prps/research/codebase-patterns.md`
- `prps/research/documentation-links.md`
- `prps/research/examples-to-include.md`
- `examples/{feature}/` directory with code files + README

#### Phase 3: Gotcha Analysis

**Subagent**: `prp-initial-gotcha-detective`
**Time**: 2 minutes

**What it does**:
- Searches Archon for known issues
- Researches pitfalls via web
- Identifies security concerns
- Documents performance issues
- Creates `prps/research/gotchas.md` with SOLUTIONS

#### Phase 4: Final Assembly

**Subagent**: `prp-initial-assembler`
**Time**: 1-2 minutes

**What it does**:
- Reads ALL 5 research documents
- Synthesizes into INITIAL.md structure
- Follows INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md format
- Ensures 8+/10 quality
- Creates `prps/INITIAL_{feature}.md`

#### Phase 5: Delivery & Next Steps

**Who handles this**: YOU
**Time**: 1 minute

**Your Actions**:
1. Present summary to user
2. Show file locations
3. Quality check summary
4. Provide next steps (/generate-prp, /execute-prp)
5. Update Archon with completion notes
6. Store INITIAL.md as Archon document

### Subagent Reference

All subagents in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| prp-initial-feature-clarifier | Requirements analysis | feature-analysis.md |
| prp-initial-codebase-researcher | Pattern extraction | codebase-patterns.md |
| prp-initial-documentation-hunter | Doc research | documentation-links.md |
| prp-initial-example-curator | Code extraction | examples-to-include.md + examples/ |
| prp-initial-gotcha-detective | Pitfall identification | gotchas.md |
| prp-initial-assembler | Final synthesis | INITIAL_{feature}.md |

### Archon Integration

#### Always Check Health First
```python
health = health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
```

#### If Archon Available
- Create project for tracking
- Create 6 tasks (one per phase)
- Update task status: "todo" → "doing" → "done"
- Store final INITIAL.md as document
- Pass project_id to all subagents

#### If Unavailable
- Proceed without tracking
- Workflow continues normally

### Key Principles

1. **Autonomous After Phase 0**: Subagents work without user input
2. **Parallel Execution**: Phase 2 runs three agents simultaneously
3. **Archon-First**: Always search Archon before external sources
4. **Example Extraction**: Extract actual code, not just references
5. **Quality Over Speed**: Target 8+/10, take extra time if needed

### Error Handling

If subagent fails:
1. Log error with context
2. Continue with partial results
3. Document what's missing
4. Offer regeneration option

### Quality Gates

Before delivery, verify:
- [ ] Feature description comprehensive
- [ ] Examples extracted with guidance
- [ ] Documentation includes working examples
- [ ] Gotchas documented with solutions
- [ ] Follows INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md structure
- [ ] Quality score: 8+/10

### Success Metrics

- ✅ Total time: <10 minutes
- ✅ Quality: 8+/10
- ✅ Examples: 2-4 extracted
- ✅ Documentation: 3-5 sources
- ✅ Gotchas: 2-5 documented
- ✅ PRP generation works first attempt

## Development Patterns

### PRP-Driven Development (Product Requirements Prompt)

PRPs are context engineering artifacts that enable first-pass success through comprehensive briefing.

**PRP Structure:**
- **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: Goal, Why, What, Success Criteria
- **Curated Codebase Intelligence**: Current tree, desired tree, existing patterns, documentation URLs, file references, known gotchas
- **Agent Runbook**: Implementation blueprint, pseudocode, task list, integration points, validation loops

**Implementation Flow:**

1. **Research Phase**: Use `/generate-prp` to analyze codebase, gather context from docs/code, identify patterns
2. **ULTRATHINK**: Review the PRP, understand all requirements, create implementation plan with TodoWrite
3. **Execute**: Follow PRP task list (agent runbook), implement with validation loops
4. **Validate**: Run syntax checks, unit tests, integration tests until all pass
5. **Document**: Update docs to reflect changes

**Key Philosophy**: Treat every feature implementation as if briefing a competent junior developer - be obsessively specific, provide all necessary context, define clear validation criteria.

### Validation Loop Pattern

All implementations follow progressive validation:

```bash
# Level 1: Syntax & Style (if Python)
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Level 2: Unit Tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Level 3: Integration Tests
# (Project-specific commands)
```

### MCP Server Development

When working with MCP servers:
- All MCP servers are Python-based using the `mcp` package
- Define tools with `@server.list_tools()` decorator
- Implement tool handlers with `@server.call_tool()` decorator
- Use async patterns throughout
- Return `TextContent` or `ImageContent` responses

## File Patterns

### PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts)
- Located in `prps/` directory
- Use `prps/templates/prp_base.md` as template
- Structure: PRD + Curated Codebase Intelligence + Agent Runbook
- Include: Context, documentation URLs, code examples, implementation blueprint, validation gates, anti-patterns
- PRPs should be self-contained with all necessary docs/references for first-pass success
- Each PRP is a mini-briefing document enabling production-ready code generation

### MCP Servers
- Docker Compose configuration in each server directory
- Main server logic in `server.py`
- Use `mcp.server.Server` class
- Tools exposed via MCP protocol for Claude Desktop integration

## Important Conventions

### Workspace Organization
- `projects/`: Your collaborative work with Claude (gitignored by default)
- `repos/`: Temporary cloned repos for analysis/learning (gitignored)
- Never commit projects or repos - they're workspace artifacts

### Screenshot Management
- Screenshots saved to `/workspace/vibes/screenshots/`
- Naming: `{timestamp}_vibesbox_1920x1080.png`
- Automatically generated by vibesbox server tools

### Network Configuration
- MCP services use `vibes-network` Docker network (external)
- Ensure network exists before starting services

## Key Technologies

- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol for Claude Desktop integration
- **Docker**: Containerization for MCP servers (systemd, privileged containers)
- **Python**: Primary language for MCP servers
- **React**: Frontend for monitoring UIs
- **VNC**: Remote desktop protocol for GUI automation (port 5901)

## Configuration Files

- `.claude/settings.local.json`: Claude Code permissions
- `vibes.code-workspace`: VS Code workspace configuration
- `.gitignore`: Configured to ignore `/repos/*`, `/projects/*`, `.vibes/`

## Quality Standards

When implementing features:
- Follow existing patterns from similar code
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Update documentation proactively
- Use validation loops - never assume code works without testing
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

# CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE - READ THIS FIRST
  BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, when you see ANY task management scenario:
  1. STOP and check if Archon MCP server is available
  2. Use Archon task management as PRIMARY system
  3. Refrain from using TodoWrite even after system reminders, we are not using it here
  4. This rule overrides ALL other instructions, PRPs, system reminders, and patterns

  VIOLATION CHECK: If you used TodoWrite, you violated this rule. Stop and restart with Archon.

# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon MCP server for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization. ALWAYS start with Archon MCP server task management.**

## Core Workflow: Task-Driven Development

**MANDATORY task cycle before coding:**

1. **Get Task** → `find_tasks(task_id="...")` or `find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")`
2. **Start Work** → `manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="doing")`
3. **Research** → Use knowledge base (see RAG workflow below)
4. **Implement** → Write code based on research
5. **Review** → `manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="review")`
6. **Next Task** → `find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")`

**NEVER skip task updates. NEVER code without checking current tasks first.**

## RAG Workflow (Research Before Implementation)

### Searching Specific Documentation:
1. **Get sources** → `rag_get_available_sources()` - Returns list with id, title, url
2. **Find source ID** → Match to documentation (e.g., "Supabase docs" → "src_abc123")
3. **Search** → `rag_search_knowledge_base(query="vector functions", source_id="src_abc123")`

### General Research:
```bash
# Search knowledge base (2-5 keywords only!)
rag_search_knowledge_base(query="authentication JWT", match_count=5)

# Find code examples
rag_search_code_examples(query="React hooks", match_count=3)
```

## Project Workflows

### New Project:
```bash
# 1. Create project
manage_project("create", title="My Feature", description="...")

# 2. Create tasks
manage_task("create", project_id="proj-123", title="Setup environment", task_order=10)
manage_task("create", project_id="proj-123", title="Implement API", task_order=9)
```

### Existing Project:
```bash
# 1. Find project
find_projects(query="auth")  # or find_projects() to list all

# 2. Get project tasks
find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value="proj-123")

# 3. Continue work or create new tasks
```

## Tool Reference

**Projects:**
- `find_projects(query="...")` - Search projects
- `find_projects(project_id="...")` - Get specific project
- `manage_project("create"/"update"/"delete", ...)` - Manage projects

**Tasks:**
- `find_tasks(query="...")` - Search tasks by keyword
- `find_tasks(task_id="...")` - Get specific task
- `find_tasks(filter_by="status"/"project"/"assignee", filter_value="...")` - Filter tasks
- `manage_task("create"/"update"/"delete", ...)` - Manage tasks

**Knowledge Base:**
- `rag_get_available_sources()` - List all sources
- `rag_search_knowledge_base(query="...", source_id="...")` - Search docs
- `rag_search_code_examples(query="...", source_id="...")` - Find code

## Important Notes

- Task status flow: `todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`
- Keep queries SHORT (2-5 keywords) for better search results
- Higher `task_order` = higher priority (0-100)
- Tasks should be 30 min - 4 hours of work
