[Claude creates files, writes code, runs the program]

You: "Make it more interesting"

## 🎯 The Vibes Philosophy

**Traditional Learning**: Read → Study → Practice → Debug → Repeat  
**Vibes Learning**: Ask → Build → Understand → Improve → Create

Instead of learning tools to build things, **describe what you want and Claude builds it while teaching you**.
