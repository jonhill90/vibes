# Reference Freshness

Reference docs are distilled summaries of external sources. They may be stale.

## Before Relying on Local Content

1. Check the **source URLs** listed at the top of each reference doc
2. Use MCP tools (context7, microsoft-learn, deepwiki) to fetch current documentation
3. If the local summary contradicts the live source, trust the live source

Local references are a starting point, not the final word.
