## 🎯 Navigation Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Start Here**: Read `README.md` for project overview
2. **Understand Vision**: Review `ToDo.md` for complete roadmap
3. **Plan Implementation**: Follow phase-by-phase approach

### Phase Implementation
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation infrastructure - start with connectivity
2. **Phase 2**: Application workloads - dependent on Phase 1 completion
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced optimization - builds on successful Phases 1 & 2

### Domain Deep-Dive
Each domain folder contains:
- `ToDo.md` - Detailed implementation planning
- Success criteria and dependencies
- Technical architecture decisions
- Implementation roadmap

## 📋 Document Types

| Document | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| README.md | Project introduction and quick start | All stakeholders |
| ToDo.md | Complete roadmap and architecture vision | Technical team, leadership |
| Phase Overview.md | Phase-specific objectives and timeline | Project managers, domain leads |
| Domain ToDo.md | Detailed technical implementation plans | Engineers, architects |

## 🚀 Implementation Workflow

1. **Phase Planning**: Review phase overview and domain ToDo files
2. **Resource Assignment**: Assign domain ownership to team members
3. **Dependency Management**: Follow strict phase order for deployment
4. **Progress Tracking**: Use ToDo checkboxes for implementation status
5. **Documentation Updates**: Keep phase overviews current with progress

## 🎯 Success Tracking

Each phase has clear completion criteria in their overview documents:
- **Technical Milestones**: Infrastructure deployed and operational
- **Documentation Standards**: Architecture and procedures documented
- **Team Readiness**: Knowledge transfer and training completed
- **Business Value**: Measurable outcomes achieved

This structure enables parallel work within phases while maintaining proper dependencies between phases.
