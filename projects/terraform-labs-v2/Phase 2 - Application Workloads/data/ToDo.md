# Application - Data Domain

## 🎯 Purpose
Modern data platform implementing medallion architecture with Azure Synapse, Databricks, Data Factory, and AI Foundry integration for analytics and machine learning workloads.

## 🏗️ Based on Sandbox Patterns
From your `apps/datahub/main.tf` - you've proven this works with:
- **Comprehensive data platform**: Synapse + Databricks + Data Factory + AI Foundry
- **Medallion architecture**: Bronze/Silver/Gold data lake layers
- **Private networking**: All services with private endpoints
- **AI integration**: Azure AI Foundry with proper RBAC
- **Cross-subscription data sources**: Network and identity integration

## 📋 Domain Components

### Analytics Workspace (`synapse/`)
- [ ] Azure Synapse Analytics workspace
- [ ] Dedicated SQL pools for data warehousing
- [ ] Serverless SQL pools for ad-hoc queries
- [ ] Apache Spark pools for big data processing
- [ ] Integration with Data Lake Storage
- [ ] Private endpoints and network security

### Data Orchestration (`data-factory/`)
- [ ] Azure Data Factory for ETL/ELT pipelines
- [ ] Integration runtimes for hybrid connectivity
- [ ] Linked services to all data sources
- [ ] Datasets and data flows
- [ ] Pipeline monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Git integration for source control

### Data Lake Storage (`storage/`)
- [ ] **Bronze layer**: Raw data ingestion (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- [ ] **Silver layer**: Cleansed and enriched data (Delta Lake)
- [ ] **Gold layer**: Business-ready aggregated data (Delta Lake)
- [ ] Access control and security
- [ ] Data lifecycle management
- [ ] Performance optimization (hot/cool/archive tiers)

### Advanced Analytics (`databricks/`)
- [ ] Azure Databricks workspace (Premium tier)
- [ ] VNet injection for secure networking
- [ ] Unity Catalog for data governance
- [ ] Cluster configurations and policies
- [ ] Secret scopes with Key Vault integration
- [ ] Mount points for data lake access
- [ ] CI/CD for notebooks and jobs

## 🤖 AI Platform Integration
