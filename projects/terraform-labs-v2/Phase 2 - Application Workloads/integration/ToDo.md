# Application - Integration Domain

## 🎯 Purpose
API management, messaging, and integration services enabling event-driven architecture, service connectivity, and workflow automation across the platform.

## 🏗️ Based on Enterprise Patterns
Building on enterprise integration needs for:
- **API-first architecture**: Centralized API management and governance
- **Event-driven systems**: Asynchronous messaging and event processing
- **Workflow automation**: Business process automation
- **Service connectivity**: Secure service-to-service communication

## 📋 Domain Components

- [ ] API gateway for all platform services
- [ ] Developer portal for API documentation
- [ ] API versioning and lifecycle management
- [ ] Authentication and authorization (OAuth, JWT)
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling policies
- [ ] Analytics and monitoring

### Workflow Automation (`logic-apps/`)
- [ ] Azure Logic Apps for business workflows
- [ ] Integration with SaaS applications
- [ ] Data transformation and mapping
- [ ] Approval workflows and notifications
- [ ] Scheduled automation tasks
- [ ] Error handling and retry policies
- [ ] B2B integration scenarios

### Event-Driven Architecture (`event-grid/`)
- [ ] **Azure Event Grid**: Event routing and delivery
- [ ] **Azure Service Bus**: Reliable messaging queues and topics
- [ ] **Azure Event Hubs**: High-throughput event streaming
- [ ] Event schema registry and governance
- [ ] Dead letter queues and error handling
- [ ] Event monitoring and analytics

## 🚀 Evolution to AVM
- [ ] Evaluate `avm/res/api-management/service` module
