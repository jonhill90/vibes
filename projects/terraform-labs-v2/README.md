# Terraform Labs v2 - Modern Azure Landing Zone Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

A comprehensive Azure Landing Zone project built with modern cloud-native patterns, showcasing enterprise-grade infrastructure capabilities through a phased implementation approach.

## 📋 Project Phases

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Platform Foundation
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Status**: Planning

Core platform services that enable everything else:

- **🌐 Connectivity** - Hub-spoke networking, DNS, private endpoints
- **🔐 Identity** - Azure AD integration, Key Vaults, RBAC automation  
- **📊 Management** - Monitoring, governance, cost optimization
- **🔄 DevOps** - Azure DevOps as infrastructure, automated pipelines

### 🎯 Phase 2: Application Workloads  
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **Status**: Waiting for Phase 1

Business value applications leveraging platform foundation:

- **🗄️ Data Platform** - Analytics, AI Foundry, modern data stack
- **💻 Compute Services** - VMs, containers, image management
- **🔗 Integration Hub** - API management, messaging, event-driven architecture
- **🎓 Learning Labs** - Certification environments, experimentation space

### 🎯 Phase 3: Advanced Integration
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Status**: Future Planning

Advanced scenarios and optimization:

- Multi-region deployment patterns
- Advanced security controls
- Cost optimization automation
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review Project Vision** - Read the complete `ToDo.md` for detailed roadmap
2. **Phase 1 Planning** - Start with platform foundation components
3. **Dependencies** - Follow the deployment order outlined in each phase
