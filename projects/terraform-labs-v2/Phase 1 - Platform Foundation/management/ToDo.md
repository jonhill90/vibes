# Platform - Management Domain

## 🎯 Purpose
Centralized monitoring, governance, cost management, and operational excellence across the Azure landing zone with observability and automation.

## 🏗️ Based on Sandbox Patterns
From your `azure/monitoring/main.tf` and enterprise patterns - you've proven this works with:
- Centralized Log Analytics workspace
- Azure Policy for governance
- Cost management and budgeting
- Application Insights integration
- Cross-subscription monitoring

## 📋 Domain Components

### Monitoring Infrastructure (`monitoring/`)
- [ ] Central Log Analytics workspace
- [ ] Application Insights for applications
- [ ] Azure Monitor workbooks and dashboards
- [ ] Alert rules and action groups
- [ ] Diagnostic settings automation
- [ ] Network monitoring (Connection Monitor, Network Watcher)

### Policy & Governance (`policy/`)
- [ ] Azure Policy definitions and initiatives
- [ ] Policy assignments at management group level
- [ ] Compliance monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Resource tagging enforcement
- [ ] Security baseline policies
- [ ] Cost optimization policies

### Automation Infrastructure (`automation/`)
- [ ] Azure Automation accounts
- [ ] Runbooks for operational tasks
- [ ] Update Management for VMs
- [ ] Start/Stop automation for cost savings
- [ ] Backup automation and scheduling
- [ ] Disaster recovery automation

### Cost Management (`cost-mgmt/`)
- [ ] Budgets and spending alerts
- [ ] Cost analysis and reporting
- [ ] Resource optimization recommendations
- [ ] Reservation management
- [ ] Chargeback and showback reporting
- [ ] Resource lifecycle automation

## 🚀 Evolution to AVM
- [ ] Evaluate `avm/res/insights/workspace` for Log Analytics
- [ ] Implement `avm/res/automation/automation-account` patterns
- [ ] Standardize monitoring configurations
- [ ] Automate policy deployment with AVM

## 📊 Observability Strategy
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring (VMs, networks, storage)
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Security monitoring and SIEM integration
- [ ] Cost and resource optimization monitoring
- [ ] Business metrics and KPIs

## 🏢 Enterprise Features
- [ ] Azure Sentinel for security operations
- [ ] Azure Arc for hybrid monitoring
- [ ] Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- [ ] Service Map for dependency tracking
- [ ] Change tracking and inventory

## 🔗 Integration Points
- **Identity Domain**: RBAC for monitoring resources
- **Connectivity Domain**: Network monitoring and NSG flow logs
- **All Domains**: Diagnostic settings and monitoring

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Centralized monitoring for all resources
- [ ] Automated governance and compliance
- [ ] Cost visibility and optimization
- [ ] Operational automation in place
- [ ] Security monitoring integrated

## 📝 Notes
Management is deployed **third** after connectivity and identity - provides operational foundation for all workloads.
