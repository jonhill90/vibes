# Platform - DevOps Domain

## 🎯 Purpose
Azure DevOps infrastructure as code, build agents, service connections, and CI/CD automation enabling self-service developer capabilities.

## 🏗️ Based on Sandbox Patterns
From your `azure/devops/main.tf` - you've proven this works with:
- Azure DevOps projects and repositories as code
- Service connections with managed identities
- Variable groups with Key Vault integration
- Multi-stage pipelines with approval gates
- Build agent infrastructure

## 📋 Domain Components

### Azure DevOps as Code (`azure-devops/`)
- [ ] Organization settings and policies
- [ ] Project creation and configuration
- [ ] Repository provisioning and permissions
- [ ] Team and security group management
- [ ] Pipeline library and templates
- [ ] Extension installation and management

### Service Connections (`service-connections/`)
- [ ] Azure Resource Manager connections with managed identities
- [ ] GitHub service connections for source control
- [ ] Container registry connections
- [ ] Third-party service integrations
- [ ] Connection permissions and scope management
- [ ] Automated connection lifecycle

### Variable Groups (`variable-groups/`)
- [ ] Environment-specific variable groups
- [ ] Key Vault linked variable groups
- [ ] Secret management automation
- [ ] Variable templating and inheritance
- [ ] Access control and security

### Build Infrastructure (`agents/`)
- [ ] Self-hosted agent pools
- [ ] Azure VM Scale Sets for agents
- [ ] Container-based agents (ACI)
- [ ] Custom agent images with required tooling
- [ ] Auto-scaling and cost optimization
- [ ] Agent pool management and monitoring

## 🚀 Evolution to AVM
- [ ] Evaluate AVM modules for Azure DevOps resources
- [ ] Implement container-based agents with ACI modules
- [ ] Standardize agent configurations
- [ ] Automate agent image building

## 🔄 CI/CD Capabilities
- [ ] Infrastructure pipeline templates
- [ ] Application deployment pipelines
- [ ] Security scanning integration (tfsec, Checkov)
- [ ] Testing automation (Terratest, Pester)
- [ ] Release management and approvals
- [ ] Pipeline monitoring and analytics

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance
- [ ] Pipeline security scanning
- [ ] Secret scanning and management
- [ ] Code quality gates
- [ ] Compliance reporting
- [ ] Audit trails and logging
- [ ] Access control automation

## 🏢 Enterprise Patterns
- [ ] Self-service project provisioning
- [ ] Standardized pipeline templates
- [ ] Automated onboarding workflows
- [ ] Cost tracking and optimization
- [ ] Disaster recovery for DevOps infrastructure

## 🔗 Integration Points
- **Identity Domain**: Service principals and RBAC
- **Management Domain**: Monitoring and cost tracking
- **All Domains**: CI/CD pipelines and deployments

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Azure DevOps fully automated
- [ ] Self-service capabilities for teams
- [ ] Secure and compliant pipelines
- [ ] Scalable build infrastructure
- [ ] Complete audit and monitoring

## 📝 Notes
DevOps is deployed **fourth** after foundation platforms - enables automated deployment of all other components.
