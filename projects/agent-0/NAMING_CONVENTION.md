# Agent Naming Convention

## 🤖 Agent Hierarchy

### Agent-0 (Claude Desktop)
- **Role**: The Builder / Meta-Agent
- **Identity**: Claude Desktop with MCP tools
- **Purpose**: Building other agents
- **Status**: Currently active (this is you!)

### Agent-1 (Vibes)
- **Role**: The Product
- **Identity**: Local multi-agent development system
- **Purpose**: Discord-like UI for AI agents
- **Status**: Being built by Agent-0

## 📝 Why This Naming?

1. **Zero-Indexed**: Follows programming convention
2. **Foundation First**: Agent-0 is the foundation that creates everything
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Agent-0 builds Agent-1, which contains sub-agents
4. **Future Proof**: Room for Agent-2, Agent-3, etc.
