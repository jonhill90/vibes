# Agent-0 Project: Detailed Context

## üé≠ The Two Agents Explained

### Agent-0 (Claude Desktop) - The Builder
- **What**: Claude Desktop with MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- **Role**: The AI developer building the actual system
- **Current Tools**: run_command via mcp-vibes-server
- **Limitation**: Can't see UI, can't control browsers, manual MCP config updates

### Agent-1 (Vibes) - The Product Being Built
- **What**: A local Manus alternative with Discord-like UI
- **Purpose**: Multi-agent AI system for development tasks
- **Agents Include**: Browser, Code, File, Research, Planner agents
- **Key Feature**: Users can SEE what agents are doing (like screen sharing)

## üîç Why This Approach?

The human realized: "I should use the most capable AI I have (Claude Desktop) to build my AI system rather than trying to code it all myself."

But there's a problem: Claude Desktop (Agent-0) is like a master craftsman working blindfolded with limited tools.

## üí° The Critical Insight: The MCP Config Problem

### Current Painful Workflow:
1. Claude creates new MCP server using run_command ‚úì
2. Human must manually edit `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json` ‚úó
3. Human must restart Claude Desktop ‚úó
4. Test if it works
5. If not, repeat entire cycle ‚úó

### Example:
```json
// Human has to manually add this to claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "new-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/new-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

This manual process kills development velocity!

## üéØ The Solution: MCP Middleware

### Concept:
```
Claude Desktop 
    ‚Üì (configured ONCE)
MCP Middleware Server (always running)
    ‚Üì (loads dynamically)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Screenshot MCP (loaded when needed)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Browser MCP (loaded when needed)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Any Future MCP (no config changes!)
```

### How It Works:
1. Human adds MCP Middleware to config ONCE
2. Claude can then load/reload any MCP dynamically
3. No more config edits, no more restarts
4. Instant testing and iteration

## üìÇ Project Structure Explained

### Main Project Location:
- `/workspace/vibes/` - The main Vibes project
- `/workspace/vibes/projects/Agent-0/` - This Agent-0 enhancement project

### Critical Directories:
- `/workspace/vibes/mcp/mcp-vibes-server/` - DO NOT MODIFY (provides run_command)
- `/workspace/vibes/concept/` - Discord-like UI mockup
- `/workspace/vibes/repos/` - Reference projects (OpenHands, AgenticSeek, etc.)

### Why These References Matter:
- **lightpanda-browser**: Lightweight browser for agent web automation
- **browserless**: Alternative browser automation approach
- **AgenticSeek**: Example of local-first AI agents
- **OpenHands**: Multi-agent architecture reference

## üö® Critical Rules for Next Session

1. **NEVER modify mcp-vibes-server** - It's Claude's only way to run commands
2. **Complete phases in order** - No skipping to "save time"
3. **Test before progressing** - Each phase must work before moving on
4. **Work in vibes directory** - Not in /workspace root
5. **One config entry** - Only MCP Middleware in claude_desktop_config.json

## üé¨ Current State Summary

### What Works:
- Claude can create/modify files
- Claude can run commands via mcp-vibes-server
- Project structure is set up
- Vision is clear

### What's Broken:
- Claude can't see UI (no screenshots)
- Claude can't control browsers (no testing)
- Claude can't run persistent processes
- Manual MCP config updates required

### Next Immediate Step:
Build MCP Middleware to solve the config update problem, enabling rapid development of all other capabilities.

## üí¨ Key Conversations & Decisions

1. **"I don't care to use Ollama Models"** - User wants to use cloud LLMs (AWS Bedrock/Azure OpenAI) for Agent-1, not local models

2. **"You are like Agent 0 building Agent 1"** - This framing is crucial: Claude Desktop is the builder creating the actual product

3. **"We need a MCP Server Middle man"** - The middleware insight that unlocks everything

4. **"The Notebook mcp is our attempt at Automatic Documentation"** - Existing MCP for documentation, will enhance later

## üîß Technical Context

### MCP (Model Context Protocol):
- Protocol for extending Claude Desktop with tools
- Each MCP server provides specific capabilities
- Currently requires manual config and restart to add new ones

### Current MCP Servers Available:
- mcp-vibes-server (run_command)
- mcp-github-server (GitHub integration)
- mcp-notebook-server (documentation attempts)
- mcp-basic-memory-server (simple storage)
- mcp-terraform-server, mcp-azure-server (cloud tools)

### What Makes MCP Middleware Special:
- It's the ONLY MCP that needs manual configuration
- All other MCPs load through it dynamically
- Provides real-time feedback via SSE/WebSocket
- Enables hot-reload during development

## üéØ Success Looks Like

### Phase 1 Success (MCP Middleware):
- Create one new MCP without editing config
- Load it dynamically
- Test it immediately
- See results in real-time

### Ultimate Success:
- Claude can see the Discord-like UI
- Claude can modify and test it
- Claude can manage all processes
- Development velocity increases 10x
- Vibes (Agent-1) gets built efficiently
