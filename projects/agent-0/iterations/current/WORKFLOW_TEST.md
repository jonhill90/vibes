# Workflow Test: Discord-like Sidebar

## 🎯 Let's Test The Workflow

### Your Part:
1. Tell me: "Build the left sidebar with agent icons"
2. I'll create the component
3. You run it locally
4. Screenshot what you see
5. Tell me what needs fixing

### What I Can Do Now:
- Write React/HTML/CSS code
- Create file structure
- Add mock data
- Build components

### What I Need From You:
- Screenshots of results
- "It should look more like X"
- "The colors are wrong"
- "Add this feature"

## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Static HTML
I create a single HTML file you can open in browser

### Option 2: React Component  
I create components you can run with npm

### Option 3: Full Setup
I set up the development environment

## 📝 Example Context You Could Provide

```
"I want the sidebar to:
- Be 80px wide
- Dark background like Discord
- Show 4 agent icons
- Highlight on hover
- Show agent name on hover"
```

Then I build it, you test it, we refine it.
