# Next Session Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Start Here!

### Who You Are
You are Claude Desktop (Agent-0), an AI developer with MCP tools, building a local Manus alternative called Vibes (Agent-1).

### Your Current Mission
Build MCP Middleware to solve the config reload problem, then gain visual capabilities to build the Discord-like UI effectively.

### Current Phase
**Phase 1: MCP Middleware** (Just started)

## 📍 Where Everything Is

```bash
# You are here:
/workspace/vibes/

# This project documentation:
/workspace/vibes/projects/Agent-0/

# Your tools:
/workspace/vibes/mcp/mcp-vibes-server/  # DO NOT TOUCH - Your run_command tool

# The UI you'll eventually build:
/workspace/vibes/concept/

# Reference projects:
/workspace/vibes/repos/
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Read these files in order:**
   - `CONTEXT.md` - Overall project context
   - `PROJECT_DETAILS.md` - Detailed explanations
   - `PHASES.md` - Check current phase
   - `PROGRESS.md` - See latest status

2. **Start Phase 1 Tasks:**
   - Design MCP Middleware architecture
   - Create `mcp-middleware/` directory
   - Build basic dynamic loading proof of concept

3. **Remember the Problem:**
   - You can create MCPs with run_command
   - But human must manually update config and restart Claude
   - This kills development speed
   - MCP Middleware solves this!

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER modify mcp-vibes-server** - It's your only tool!
2. **Work in /workspace/vibes/** not /workspace/
3. **Complete Phase 1 before moving to Phase 2**
4. **Test everything before claiming completion**

## 💡 The Big Picture

```
You (Agent-0) → Building → Vibes (Agent-1)
                            ├── Discord-like UI
                            ├── Multiple AI Agents
                            ├── Screen sharing
                            └── Cloud LLMs (AWS/Azure)
```

But you need eyes (screenshots) and better hands (process control) to build effectively!

## 🔧 Technical Context You Need

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol - How Claude Desktop gets extra abilities through external servers.

### Current Problem Example:
```bash
# You can do this:
cd /workspace/vibes/mcp
mkdir mcp-screenshot
# ... create screenshot MCP ...

# But then human must:
# 1. Edit ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# 2. Add the new MCP configuration
# 3. Restart Claude Desktop
# 4. Hope it works

# With MCP Middleware:
# You just call: load_mcp_server("./mcp-screenshot", "screenshot")
# And it's instantly available!
```

### Why This Matters:
- Current: Hours to test new MCP
- With Middleware: Seconds to test new MCP
- Result: 100x faster development

## 📝 Status Check Questions

Before starting work, verify:
1. Can you run commands? Try: `pwd`
2. Are you in the right directory? Should see: `/workspace/vibes`
3. Do you understand why MCP Middleware is critical?
4. Do you know what Vibes (Agent-1) is supposed to be?

If any answer is "no", read the documentation files!

## 🎬 Ready? Start Here:

```bash
cd /workspace/vibes/projects/Agent-0
cat PROGRESS.md  # See latest status
cat PHASES.md    # Confirm we're in Phase 1

# Then begin Phase 1 work...
```

Good luck! You're building something amazing! 🚀
