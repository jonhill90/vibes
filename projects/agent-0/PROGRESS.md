# Agent-0 Development Progress

## Date: 2024-06-14
### Phase: 0 (Foundation)
### Tasks Completed:
- Created Agent-0 project structure
- Documented context in CONTEXT.md
- Created phase plan in PHASES.md
- Listed required capabilities in CAPABILITIES.md
- Established development workflow

### Current Understanding:
- Agent-0 (Claude Desktop) needs enhanced capabilities to build Agent-1 (Vibes)
- Main bottleneck: Manual MCP configuration updates
- Solution: MCP Middleware for dynamic loading
- Critical need: Visual feedback (screenshots/browser control)

### Next Steps:
- Get approval to move to Phase 1
- Design MCP Middleware architecture
- Create proof of concept for dynamic MCP loading

### Blockers:
- None currently

## Key Decisions Made:
1. **MCP Middleware First** - Solves the config reload problem
2. **Visual Capabilities Second** - Need to see to build
3. **Iterative Approach** - Complete each phase before moving on
4. **No Touching mcp-vibes-server** - It's the critical infrastructure

## Important Context:
- Working directory: `/workspace/vibes`
- Agent-0 project: `/workspace/vibes/projects/Agent-0`
- Existing MCPs: vibes, github, notebook, memory, terraform, azure
- Vision: Discord-like UI for AI agents with local-first approach

## Date: 2024-06-14 (Update)
### Rebranding Complete
- Renamed Agent-1 → Agent-0 (Claude Desktop as the foundational builder)
- Renamed Agent-2 → Agent-1 (Vibes as the product being built)
- Updated all documentation to reflect new naming
- Created NAMING_CONVENTION.md for clarity
- Zero-indexed naming aligns with programming conventions
