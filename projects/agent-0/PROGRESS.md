# Agent-0 Development Progress

## Date: 2024-06-14
### Phase: 0 (Foundation)
### Tasks Completed:
- Created Agent-0 project structure
- Documented context in CONTEXT.md
- Created phase plan in PHASES.md
- Listed required capabilities in CAPABILITIES.md
- Established development workflow

### Current Understanding:
- Agent-0 (Claude Desktop) needs enhanced capabilities to build Agent-1 (Vibes)
- Main bottleneck: Manual MCP configuration updates
- Solution: MCP Middleware for dynamic loading
- Critical need: Visual feedback (screenshots/browser control)

### Next Steps:
- Get approval to move to Phase 1
- Design MCP Middleware architecture
- Create proof of concept for dynamic MCP loading

### Blockers:
- None currently

## Key Decisions Made:
1. **MCP Middleware First** - Solves the config reload problem
2. **Visual Capabilities Second** - Need to see to build
3. **Iterative Approach** - Complete each phase before moving on
4. **No Touching mcp-vibes-server** - It's the critical infrastructure

## Important Context:
- Working directory: `/workspace/vibes`
- Agent-0 project: `/workspace/vibes/projects/Agent-0`
- Existing MCPs: vibes, github, notebook, memory, terraform, azure
- Vision: Discord-like UI for AI agents with local-first approach

## Date: 2024-06-14 (Update)
### Rebranding Complete
- Renamed Agent-1 â†’ Agent-0 (Claude Desktop as the foundational builder)
- Renamed Agent-2 â†’ Agent-1 (Vibes as the product being built)
- Updated all documentation to reflect new naming
- Created NAMING_CONVENTION.md for clarity
- Zero-indexed naming aligns with programming conventions

### Current Situation Assessment
- Concept UI is already running in Docker container on port 8082
- Container name: concept-app-container
- Browser access has been attempted (logs show HeadlessChrome requests)
- Need simple browser/screenshot tool to give Agent-0 "eyes"

### What's Already Available:
- `/workspace/vibes/repos/concept/` - The Discord-like UI mockup
- Concept is containerized and accessible on port 8082
- Chromium installed but needs snap configuration

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Create minimal HTTP-based screenshot service
2. Use existing browserless or find alternative approach
3. Document the visual feedback workflow for Agent-0

### Key Learning:
- Always check what's already running before creating new services
- The concept UI is the target we need to screenshot, not something to rebuild

### Success: Visual Capabilities Established!
- âœ“ Browserless running on port 3333
- âœ“ Screenshot tool working using Docker networking (host.docker.internal)
- âœ“ Successfully captured screenshot of Concept UI at port 8082
- âœ“ Created easy-to-use wrapper scripts:
  - `/tools/take-screenshot.sh` - Core screenshot functionality
  - `/tools/view.sh` - Simple wrapper with timestamped outputs

### Key Learning:
- Must use `host.docker.internal` when accessing services from inside Docker
- Browserless provides simple HTTP API for screenshots
- No need for complex Chrome/Chromium setup inside containers

### Tools Now Available:
```bash
# Take a screenshot
/workspace/vibes/projects/Agent-0/tools/view.sh http://host.docker.internal:8082

# View what's running
docker ps
```

Agent-0 now has eyes! ðŸ‘€
