- Creating learning projects and experiments

## Structure

```

## Workflow

1. **Describe your idea** to Claude in natural language
2. **Claude creates** the project structure and initial code
3. **Iterate together** through conversation
4. **Test and refine** using the MCP capabilities

## Example Project Ideas

```
"Let's build a simple task manager with React and local storage"
"Create a Python script that analyzes my git commit patterns"
"Build a chat interface that connects to my local Ollama instance"
"Make a web scraper that monitors product prices"
```

## Notes

- All projects are gitignored by default
- Create a separate git repo if you want to version control a project
- Use the full power of the Vibes environment (shell access, memory, etc.)
- Claude can help with everything from planning to deployment
