# Vibes: Local-First Conversational AI Development Environment

> **Vision**: A Discord-like interface for interacting with specialized AI agents that can browse, code, and execute tasks autonomously  
> **Approach**: Use Claude Desktop (Agent 1) to build a multi-agent system (Agent 2) through iterative development  
> **Philosophy**: Start local-first for privacy, then add secure cloud LLM integration  

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

### What We're Building
A **local Manus alternative** that combines:
- **Discord/Twitch-like UI** for familiar, modern interaction
- **Multiple specialized AI agents** (Browser, Code, File, Planner, Research)
- **Visual agent workspaces** where you can see what agents are doing
- **Voice interaction** for natural conversation
- **100% local execution** with option for secure cloud LLMs (AWS Bedrock/Azure OpenAI)

### Why This Approach
- **Privacy-first**: All data stays on your machine
- **Observable**: See exactly what agents are doing (like pair programming)
- **Familiar UI**: Discord-like interface that developers already know
- **Flexible LLMs**: Start local, upgrade to cloud when needed

  - [ ] Multi-agent task coordination
  - [ ] Context passing between agents
  - [ ] Conflict resolution

- [ ] **Memory System**
  - [ ] Short-term memory for current session
  - [ ] Long-term memory for learned patterns
  - [ ] User preferences and history
  - [ ] Workspace state persistence

- [ ] **Observable Execution**
  - [ ] Live view of agent workspaces
  - [ ] Step-by-step task breakdown
  - [ ] Ability to intervene/correct
  - [ ] Learning from corrections

### Phase 4: Voice Integration
**Goal**: Natural conversation with the system

- [ ] **Speech-to-Text**
  - [ ] Local STT engine integration
  - [ ] Wake word detection
  - [ ] Noise cancellation
  - [ ] Multi-language support

- [ ] **Text-to-Speech**
  - [ ] Natural voice synthesis
  - [ ] Agent-specific voices
  - [ ] Emotion and tone modulation
  - [ ] Background audio ducking

### Phase 5: Cloud LLM Integration
**Goal**: Upgrade to more powerful models while maintaining privacy

- [ ] **LLM Router**
  - [ ] Local LLM fallback (for offline/privacy)
  - [ ] AWS Bedrock integration
  - [ ] Azure OpenAI integration
  - [ ] Model selection based on task

- [ ] **Security Layer**

## 📋 Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Next Steps (with Claude Desktop)
1. **Set up visual feedback loop**
   - Get MCP tools for browser/screenshot
   - Run concept UI and show Claude

2. **Iterate on UI design**
   - Refine Discord-like interface
   - Add agent panels
   - Implement screen share view

3. **Create first agent**
   - Start with simple file agent
   - Test integration with UI
   - Establish agent communication pattern

### Development Principles
- **See to Build**: Claude needs visual feedback to develop effectively

## 🚧 Current Blockers

### For Claude Desktop (Agent 1)
1. **No Visual Feedback**: Can't see rendered UI
2. **No Browser Control**: Can't test web automation
3. **Limited Process Management**: Can't run dev servers easily

### Solutions Needed
1. **MCP Browser Server**: For visual feedback and control
2. **MCP Dev Server**: For running and managing development
3. **Better File Watching**: To see code changes reflected

*This plan focuses on using Claude Desktop as the builder (Agent 1) to create a local-first multi-agent system (Agent 2) with a familiar Discord-like interface. The key insight is that Claude needs visual capabilities through MCP to effectively build this system.*
