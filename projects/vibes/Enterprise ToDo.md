## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Iterative Development Approach
1. **Prove Core Concepts**: Migrate one MCP server equivalent to Azure, validate functionality
2. **Expand Incrementally**: Add features based on validated learnings from previous phase
3. **Tool Selection**: Choose specific tools only after testing Azure native options first
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Validate each phase with actual usage before proceeding

### Risk Mitigation
- Keep current Vibes system running during migration
- Test each Azure component independently before integration
- Maintain backwards compatibility for knowledge and conversations
- Have rollback plans for each phase

*This roadmap prioritizes Azure-native solutions first, with open source and third-party alternatives listed for context and future consideration. Tool selection happens iteratively based on actual testing and user feedback.*
