## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Installation Documentation
- **npm route**: Global installation via Node.js package manager
  - Command: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
  - Pros/cons analysis included
  - Verification steps provided

- **Homebrew route**: macOS/Linux native binary installation
  - Command: `brew install openai-codex`
  - Platform compatibility noted
  - Update mechanism documented

- **Binary download**: Air-gapped environment support
  - Direct download from GitHub releases
  - Manual PATH configuration steps
  - Platform-specific binary selection guide

#### 2. Authentication Methods
- **ChatGPT login** (Primary method):
  - Interactive browser-based flow
  - Step-by-step process documented
  - Token expiration handling
  - Verification command: `codex login status`

- **API key method** (Headless environments):
  - Secure stdin-based entry (`--with-api-key`)
  - Manual auth.json creation
  - Security considerations (file permissions, key rotation)
  - CI/CD use case guidance

- **SSH port forwarding** (Remote machines):
  - Port forwarding setup: `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080`
  - Alternative: auth.json file copy
  - Remote authentication workflow

#### 3. Verification Steps
- **CLI installation check**: `which codex`, `codex --version`
- **Authentication verification**: `codex login status`
- **Sandbox test**: `codex exec --sandbox read-only "echo test"`
- **Profile validation**: `codex config show --profile codex-prp`

#### 4. Troubleshooting Guide
Addresses top 5 failure modes from gotchas.md:

1. **Authentication loop/silent failure**:
   - Clear browser cache and re-login
   - Switch to API key authentication
   - Check auth file permissions

2. **Binary not found (PATH configuration)**:
   - Find binary location (npm/brew)
   - Add to PATH (bash/zsh)
   - Reload shell configuration

3. **Permission errors (file ownership)**:
   - Fix binary permissions: `chmod +x`
   - Fix auth file permissions: `chmod 600`
   - Fix workspace permissions

4. **Network/firewall blocking**:
   - Check firewall rules
   - Configure proxy settings
   - Test OpenAI API connectivity

5. **Windows compatibility issues**:
   - Use WSL (recommended)
   - Forward slash paths in config
   - Sandbox escalation guidance

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Authentication Loop / Silent Failure
**From PRP**: "Codex does NOT read OPENAI_API_KEY env var"

**Implementation**:
- Documented that `codex login` is required (env var insufficient)
- Added verification step: `codex login status`
- Troubleshooting section covers token expiration
- Security note: Use `--with-api-key` (stdin) not `--api-key` flag

#### Gotcha #2: Binary Not Found
**From PRP**: "PATH configuration issues after installation"

**Implementation**:
- Documented PATH setup for bash/zsh
- Included `which codex` verification
- npm/brew location finding commands
- Shell reload instructions

#### Gotcha #3: Windows Platform Issues
**From PRP**: "Windows support experimental, recommend WSL"

**Implementation**:
- Dedicated "Windows Compatibility Issues" troubleshooting section
- WSL installation instructions
- Path separator guidance (forward slashes)
- Sandbox escalation workaround

#### Gotcha #4: Permission Errors
**From PRP**: "Auth file permissions must be 600"

**Implementation**:
- Documented file permission requirements
- Included `chmod 600 ~/.codex/auth.json` command
- Binary ownership fix: `chown $USER`
- Workspace permission troubleshooting

#### Gotcha #5: Network/Firewall Blocking
**From PRP**: "Corporate firewalls may block OpenAI API"

**Implementation**:
- Firewall status check commands (macOS/Linux)
- Proxy configuration example
- Connectivity test: `curl -I https://api.openai.com`

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- PRP Section: "Feature Analysis" (requirements extracted)
- PRP Section: "Documentation Links" (external references validated)
- PRP Section: "Known Gotchas" (top 5 gotchas addressed)

### External Dependencies:
- Node.js 16+ (for npm installation route)

- OpenAI account (for authentication)
- curl/wget (for binary download route)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All 3 installation routes documented with commands
- [x] All 3 authentication methods explained with examples
- [x] Verification steps include testable commands
- [x] Troubleshooting covers top 5 failures from gotchas.md

- [x] Authentication methods (ChatGPT login, API key, SSH forwarding) ✓
- [x] Verification steps (CLI check, auth status, sandbox test) ✓
- [x] Troubleshooting guide (top 5 failures from gotchas.md) ✓
- [x] No [TODO] placeholders ✓

- Clear section hierarchy (Installation → Auth → Verification → Troubleshooting)
- Code examples for all commands
- Platform-specific guidance (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Security best practices highlighted
- Health check script included for validation

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Three Installation Routes
**Rationale**: Different environments require different installation methods
- npm: Universal (Node.js users)
- Homebrew: Native binary (macOS/Linux)
- Binary download: Air-gapped/restricted environments

### Decision 2: ChatGPT Login as Primary Auth
**Rationale**: Simpler UX, no credential management
- API key documented as secondary for headless/CI
- SSH port forwarding for remote machines
- Security notes for all methods

### Decision 3: Troubleshooting Focus on Top 5 Gotchas
**Rationale**: Address most common failures first
- Auth loop (most critical)
- Binary not found (common on new installs)
- Permissions (frequent on macOS/Linux)
- Network blocking (corporate environments)
- Windows issues (experimental platform)

### Decision 4: Include Health Check Script
**Rationale**: Automated validation reduces setup friction
- 4 checks: CLI installed, authenticated, sandbox works, profile configured
- Clear output (✓ or ✗ with actionable message)
- Executable bash script ready to use

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Balancing Detail vs. Brevity
**Issue**: Bootstrap guide could become overwhelming with too much detail

**Solution**:
- Structured into clear sections (Installation → Auth → Verification → Troubleshooting)
- Used expandable troubleshooting sub-sections
- Included "Quick Start Commands" for experienced users

### Challenge 2: Platform Compatibility Coverage
**Issue**: Windows, macOS, and Linux have different behaviors

**Solution**:
- Documented platform-specific sections where needed
- Recommended WSL for Windows (experimental native support)
- Included platform detection in health check script

### Challenge 3: Security Guidance
**Issue**: API key authentication has security implications

**Solution**:
- Highlighted secure stdin method (`--with-api-key`)
- Warned against `--api-key` flag (shell history exposure)
- Documented file permissions (600 for auth.json)
- Noted key rotation best practices
