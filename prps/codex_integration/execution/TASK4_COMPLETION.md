## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Pre-Flight Validation (5 Critical Checks)

**Check 1: CLI Installation**
- Detects missing Codex binary in PATH
- Provides installation instructions (npm, brew, binary)
- Shows installed version on success

**Check 2: Authentication Status**
- Validates `codex login status` succeeds
- Provides authentication methods (ChatGPT, API key)
- Includes troubleshooting steps for common auth issues

**Check 3: Profile Configuration**
- Checks profile exists in config.toml
- Validates all required fields (model, approval_policy, sandbox_mode, cwd)
- Lists missing fields with example values

**Check 4: Sandbox Dry-Run Test**
- Tests actual sandbox execution with safe read-only mode
- Catches sandbox configuration errors before real execution
- Provides profile setting recommendations on failure

**Check 5: File Structure Writability**
- Validates prps/ directory exists and is writable
- Tests actual write permissions
- Provides permission fix commands

**Complete Script**: Includes `validate-bootstrap.sh` template with progress tracking (X/Y checks passed) and success rate calculation

#### 2. Validation Gates (Multi-Level Defense)

**Level 1: Config Validation**
- Validates profile configuration completeness
- Checks v0.20+ four-setting requirement:
  - approval_policy
  - bypass_approvals
  - bypass_sandbox
  - trusted_workspace
- Verifies MCP server configuration
- Provides exact TOML snippets for missing settings

**Level 2: Artifact Structure Validation**
- Checks base directory exists (prps/{feature}/codex/)
- Validates required subdirectories (logs, planning, examples)
- Ensures manifest.jsonl exists
- Validates manifest contains valid JSONL (using jq if available)
- Provides mkdir commands for missing directories

**Level 3: Manifest Coverage Validation**
- Verifies all expected phases are logged
- Checks for failed phases (exit_code != 0)
- Parses JSONL with jq or grep fallback
- Reports missing phases and failure details

#### 3. Failure Handling (Detection + Resolution)

**Detection Methods:**

1. **Exit Code Detection** - Maps common exit codes to failure types:
   - 0: success
   - 1: general_error
   - 124: timeout
   - 126: command_not_executable
   - 127: command_not_found
   - 128: git_error

2. **Stderr Pattern Detection** - Grep-based pattern matching:
   - Rate limiting: "rate limit|429|quota"
   - Timeout: "timeout|timed out"
   - Permissions: "permission denied|sandbox violation"
   - Auth: "authentication|unauthorized|401|403"
   - Not found: "not found|404"

3. **Manifest Validation** - JSONL parsing:
   - Check phase logged
   - Extract status and exit_code
   - Identify failed phases

**Resolution Paths:**

1. **Retry with Exponential Backoff** - For transient failures:
   - Max attempts: 5 (configurable)
   - Base delay: 10s (configurable)
   - Exponential: delay = base * 2^(attempt-1)
   - Only retries timeout and rate_limit failures
   - Returns immediately for non-retriable errors

2. **Escalate Sandbox Permissions** - For permission errors:
   - Detects workspace-write permission failures
   - Prompts user for approval to use danger-full-access
   - Warns about security implications
   - Executes with elevated permissions only on explicit "yes"

3. **Manual Intervention** - For non-retriable failures:
   - Identifies failure type (auth, permission, config, unknown)
   - Provides numbered resolution steps
   - Links to relevant documentation sections
   - Includes exact commands to run

#### 4. Testing Procedures

**Test 1: Dry-Run on Throwaway Feature**
- Creates test feature with full directory structure
- Runs all validation levels (1-3)
- Simulates phase execution with JSONL logging
- Validates manifest coverage
- Cleans up test artifacts automatically
- Expected: All validation levels pass, no errors

**Test 2: Approval Gate Testing**
- Tests on-request policy (expects approval prompt)
- Tests never policy with bypass (expects no prompt)
- Compares stderr output for "approve" patterns
- Validates different approval policies work correctly
- Expected: Prompts appear/disappear based on config

**Test 3: Performance Validation**
- Tests simple/medium/complex tasks with appropriate timeouts
- Measures actual duration vs timeout setting
- Warns if duration >80% of timeout (close call)
- Validates timeout settings are adequate
- Expected: All tasks complete within timeout, no close calls

#### 5. Integration Example

**Complete Workflow Script:**
- Pre-flight validation
- Level 1-3 validation gates
- Phase execution with retry logic
- Manifest coverage validation
- Error handling with manual intervention
- Shows end-to-end integration of all validation procedures

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Authentication Loop / Silent Failure
**Implementation**:
- `validate_authentication()` checks `codex login status` before execution
- Provides clear instructions for ChatGPT login and API key methods
- Includes troubleshooting for expired tokens and browser issues
- Referenced in pre-flight Check 2

**Why Critical**: All Codex operations fail without auth, often with cryptic errors that don't indicate root cause.

#### Gotcha #2: Sandbox Permission Denial (v0.20+ Four Settings)
**Implementation**:
- `validate_config_level1()` checks all four required settings
- Lists exact TOML snippets for missing settings
- `escalate_sandbox_with_approval()` provides safe escalation path
- `validate_sandbox()` runs dry-run test to catch issues early
- Referenced in pre-flight Check 4 and Level 1 validation

**Why Critical**: Even with correct sandbox mode, missing bypass settings cause persistent approval prompts that block automation.

#### Gotcha #3: MCP Server Startup Timeout
**Implementation**:
- Pre-flight checks don't include MCP validation (out of scope for bootstrap)
- Level 1 warns if no MCP servers configured
- Documentation references timeout settings in config validation
- Resolution paths include increasing startup_timeout_sec

**Why Critical**: MCP servers (Archon, Memory) fail silently if timeout too short, breaking task tracking and context.

#### Gotcha #4: Tool Timeout on Long-Running Phases
**Implementation**:
- Performance validation test (Test 3) measures duration vs timeout
- Warns if tasks complete close to timeout threshold (>80%)
- Recommends timeout scaling (simple: 60s, medium: 300s, complex: 600s)
- Retry logic includes timeout detection and backoff

**Why Critical**: Complex phases (research, gotcha detection) fail mid-execution with no resume, losing all progress.

#### Gotcha #5: Approval Escalation Blocking
**Implementation**:
- Approval gate testing (Test 2) validates prompt behavior
- Level 1 checks approval_policy and bypass_approvals settings
- Documentation explains on-request vs on-failure vs never policies
- Resolution includes profile switching recommendation

**Why Critical**: Automated workflows hang indefinitely waiting for stdin approval with no timeout or fallback.

#### Gotcha #6: Path Pollution / Artifact Misplacement
**Implementation**:
- Level 2 validation checks artifact directory structure
- Validates all files under prps/{feature}/codex/
- Pre-flight Check 5 ensures prps/ is writable
- Resolution provides mkdir commands and cwd setting advice

**Why Critical**: Mixed artifacts (Claude + Codex) break comparison workflows and make cleanup require manual intervention.

#### Gotcha #7: Profile Drift / Configuration Pollution
**Implementation**:
- Pre-flight Check 3 validates profile exists and has required fields
- Level 1 checks for missing settings that would inherit from root
- All examples use explicit `--profile codex-prp` flag
- Resolution emphasizes always using explicit profile

**Why Critical**: Implicit profile usage causes wrong model, MCP servers, or approval policies with no indication in logs.
