## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Project Overview Section
- Tech stack documentation (Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic; Frontend: TypeScript, React)
- Testing framework reference (pytest, ruff, mypy)
- Task management integration (Archon MCP server)
- Development tools (Docker, Git)

#### 2. Development Workflow Section
- Initial setup commands (clone, install, MCP servers)
- Testing commands with examples:
  - `pytest tests/ -v` - Run all tests
  - `ruff check .` - Lint code
  - `mypy .` - Type checking
  - Combined validation command
- PRP workflow commands for both Claude and Codex

#### 3. Project Conventions Section
- Naming conventions:
  - Files: `snake_case.py`, `PascalCase.tsx`, `test_{feature}.py`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions: `snake_case()` (Python), `camelCase()` (TypeScript)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Import conventions:
  - Python: Absolute imports only (NO relative imports)
  - TypeScript: Prefer absolute imports
- PRP storage conventions:
  - Directory structure with examples
  - Naming rules (NO `prp_` prefix)
  - Initial PRPs: `INITIAL_{feature}.md`
  - Valid characters documentation
- Codex artifact conventions:
  - All Codex outputs under `prps/{feature}/codex/`
  - Clean separation from Claude outputs
  - Manifest logging structure

#### 4. Common Tasks Section
- Add new PRP (step-by-step)
- Run validation (feature-specific and code quality)
- Deploy reference

#### 5. Project Gotchas Section (Top 5 from gotchas.md)
**Gotcha #1: Authentication Required (Codex CLI)**
- Detection: `codex login status` fails
- Solution: `codex login` command

**Gotcha #2: Sandbox Mode (workspace-write)**
- Detection: Permission denied, unexpected approval prompts
- Solution: Complete TOML configuration with all 4 settings

**Gotcha #3: Timeout on Long Operations (600s recommended)**
- Detection: Exit code 124, timeout errors
- Solution: Set `tool_timeout_sec = 600` in profile

**Gotcha #4: Profile Drift (Always Use --profile Flag)**
- Detection: Unexpected model, wrong MCP servers
- Solution: Always use `--profile codex-prp` explicitly

**Gotcha #5: Redundant 'prp_' Prefix (Naming Convention)**
- Detection: Validation error, files like `prps/prp_feature.md`
- Solution: Use `prps/feature.md` (directory already indicates PRP)

#### 6. Archon Task Management Section
- Task workflow with code examples
- Task status flow (`todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`)
- Critical note: NEVER use TodoWrite (Archon MCP only)

#### 7. Quality Standards Section
- Code requirements (error handling, types, docs, tests, linting)
- PRP quality requirements (score ≥8/10, completeness, examples, gotchas)

#### 8. Agent-Specific Notes Section
- OpenAI Codex: Authentication, profile config, execution, validation
- Claude Code: Execution, task management
- Clear differentiation between agent workflows

#### 9. Documentation References Section
- Internal docs (README.md, CLAUDE.md, patterns, conventions)
- External docs (Codex CLI, MCP Protocol, Archon)

#### 10. Performance Tips Section
- PRP generation tips (parallel phases, timeouts, quality validation)
- PRP execution tips (sequential tasks, quality gates)
- Codex workflow tips (explicit profiles, pre-flight validation, manifest monitoring)

#### 11. Troubleshooting Section
- Codex authentication fails
- Sandbox permission denied
- MCP server timeout
- Tests failing
- Linting errors

#### 12. Summary Section
- 10 key points for agents
- Quick reference for essential workflows
- Pointer to README.md for detailed architecture

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #10: AGENTS.md File Missing (2-3x Performance Penalty)

**From gotchas.md lines 892-995:**

**Issue**: Codex performs poorly without AGENTS.md file in repo root. This file guides Codex on how to navigate codebase, which commands to run for testing, project conventions, and common tasks.

**Implementation in AGENTS.md**:
✅ **Tech stack documented** - Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, pytest, ruff, mypy
✅ **Testing commands complete** - pytest, ruff, mypy with examples
✅ **PRP workflow documented** - Both Claude and Codex commands
✅ **Project conventions comprehensive** - Naming, imports, storage
✅ **Common tasks detailed** - Add PRP, validation, deploy
✅ **Top 5 gotchas included** - Auth, sandbox, timeouts, profile drift, naming
✅ **Archon integration** - Task management workflow
✅ **Quality standards** - Code and PRP requirements
✅ **Agent-specific notes** - Codex vs Claude workflows
✅ **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions

**Impact measurement** (from gotchas.md):
- Before AGENTS.md: 2 minutes trial-and-error, wrong commands
- After AGENTS.md: 15 seconds direct execution, correct commands
- **Performance improvement: ~8x faster**

#### Verification Against Vibes Conventions

**Checked against `.claude/conventions/prp-naming.md` (referenced in gotchas.md #5):**
✅ Documented NO `prp_` prefix rule
✅ Included examples of correct naming
✅ Referenced `.claude/conventions/prp-naming.md` for complete rules
✅ Explained directory structure matches PRP filename

**Checked against `.claude/patterns/` (referenced in CLAUDE.md):**
✅ Referenced pattern library location
✅ Noted key patterns (archon-workflow, parallel-subagents, quality-gates)

**Checked against codebase-patterns.md:**
✅ Testing commands match project tooling (pytest, ruff, mypy)
✅ Naming conventions align with codebase patterns
✅ Import conventions match absolute import requirement (Pattern 2, anti-pattern #2)
✅ Directory structure matches feature-analysis.md requirements
✅ Quality standards align with quality-gates.md (score ≥8/10)

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- Task 1-7 (Documentation and helper scripts) - Referenced but not blocking
- PRP Task 8 specification - Complete (prps/codex_integration.md lines 796-830)
