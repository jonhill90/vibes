## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Migration Script (`migrate_to_per_domain_collections.py`)

**Purpose**: Automate migration from shared global collections to per-domain collections

**Key Features**:
- **Database Integration**: Reads sources with collection_names from PostgreSQL
- **Qdrant Collection Creation**: Creates collections with proper VectorParams
  - Documents: 1536 dimensions (text-embedding-3-small)
  - Code: 3072 dimensions (text-embedding-3-large)
  - Media: 512 dimensions (clip-vit, future)
- **Payload Indexing**: Creates source_id index on each collection for efficient filtering
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with error accumulation
- **Statistics Tracking**: MigrationStats class tracks all operations
- **Idempotent Design**: Skips collections that already exist (safe to re-run)
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview migration without making changes (--dry-run flag)
- **Verification**: Post-migration verification step to ensure all collections exist
- **Logging**: Dual logging to console and file (with timestamps)
- **CLI**: Full argparse interface with --database-url, --qdrant-url, -v flags

**Implementation Highlights**:
```python
# Collection creation with proper dimensions
await qdrant_client.create_collection(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    vectors_config=VectorParams(
        size=dimension,
        distance=Distance.COSINE
    )
)

# Payload index for source_id filtering
await qdrant_client.create_payload_index(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    field_name="source_id",
    field_schema=PayloadSchemaType.KEYWORD
)
```

**Statistics Tracking**:
- Sources processed
- Collections created
- Collections already existing (skipped)
- Collections failed
- Detailed error list with messages

**Verification**:
- Checks all expected collections exist in Qdrant
- Reports missing collections
- Validates collection count matches expectations

#### 2. TODO.md Documentation Updates

- Updated DELETE /sources to mention cascade deletion of collections

**New Section: Migration from Shared Collections** (143 lines):
- **Prerequisites** (2 steps):
  1. Backup data (PostgreSQL and Qdrant)
  2. Apply Migration 004 (with verification commands)

- **Migration Steps** (4 steps):
  1. Run migration script (with dry-run and execute examples)
  2. Verify migration (check logs and Qdrant collections)
  3. Test search (domain-filtered search command)
  4. Optional re-ingestion (two options: re-ingest or manual migration)

- **Migration Script Details**:
  - Location path
  - What it does (4 bullet points)
  - Usage examples (dry-run, execute, custom URL, verbose)
  - Idempotent note

- **Rollback Procedure** (5 steps):
  1. Stop backend
  2. Revert database schema (SQL commands)
  3. Delete per-domain collections
  4. Recreate shared collections
  5. Restart backend
  - Rollback note about re-ingestion requirement

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Migration Script Requires Migration 004 First
**Issue**: Migration script depends on collection_names column existing
**Solution**:
- Added prerequisite check documentation in README
- Script will fail gracefully if column doesn't exist
- Clear error messages guide user to apply Migration 004 first

#### Gotcha #2: Collection Dimensions Must Match Embedding Models
**Issue**: Documents use 1536d, code uses 3072d, media uses 512d
**Solution**:
- Script reads dimensions from settings.COLLECTION_DIMENSIONS
- Creates collections with proper VectorParams
- Documented in README and migration script docstring

#### Gotcha #3: Qdrant Collection Names Are Case-Sensitive
**Issue**: "AI_Knowledge_documents" != "ai_knowledge_documents"
**Solution**:
- Migration script uses exact collection names from database (populated by Migration 004)
- Sanitization preserves case for alphanumeric characters
- Documented in README collection naming pattern section

#### Gotcha #4: Payload Index Required for Efficient Filtering
**Issue**: Searching by source_id without index is slow
**Solution**:
- Migration script creates payload index on source_id field for every collection
- Documented in README architecture section
- Mentioned in migration script what-it-does list

#### Gotcha #5: Idempotent Migration for Re-runs
**Issue**: Running migration twice should not fail or duplicate collections
**Solution**:
- Script checks if collection exists before creating
- Logs "already exists" and increments stats.collections_already_exist
- Documented as "Idempotent" in README

#### Gotcha #6: Migration Doesn't Migrate Existing Vectors
**Issue**: Script only creates empty collections, doesn't copy vectors from old shared collections
**Solution**:
- Clearly documented in README "Optional: Re-ingest Documents" step
- Provided two options: re-ingest (recommended) or manual migration (advanced)
- Explained in migration script docstring as "future enhancement"

## Additional Notes

### Migration Script Features

**Comprehensive Error Handling**:
- Each collection creation wrapped in try/except
- Errors accumulated in stats.errors list
- Summary shows error count and details
- Exit code 1 if any errors occurred

**Idempotent Design**:
- Checks if collection exists before creating
- Skips existing collections (logs "already exists")
- Safe to run multiple times
- Useful for re-running after partial failures

**Dry-Run Mode**:
- Preview migration without making changes
- Logs "Would create collection" instead of creating
- Shows statistics as if migration ran
- Useful for testing before actual migration

**Verification Step**:
- Post-migration check for missing collections
- Compares expected collections with actual Qdrant collections
- Logs missing collections if any
- Provides collection count summary

**Logging**:
- Console logging for real-time progress
- File logging for audit trail (migration_to_per_domain_collections.log)
- Timestamped entries
- Structured format (timestamp - name - level - message)

**CLI Interface**:
- --database-url: Override database URL
- --qdrant-url: Override Qdrant URL
- --dry-run: Preview mode
- -v, --verbose: Debug logging
- --help: Full help documentation with examples

### Documentation Quality

**README.md Improvements**:
- Clear separation of concerns (Prerequisites, Migration Steps, Script Details, Rollback)
- Step-by-step migration guide with commands
- Examples for verification (curl commands, docker exec)
- Rollback procedure with all necessary commands
- Comprehensive architecture explanation with benefits

**TODO.md Improvements**:
- Historical context preserved (Multi-Collection phase documented)
- Clear evolution from Phase 1 to Phase 2
- Migration status checklist
- Updated schema diagram
- Architecture decisions section reflects current state

**Key Documentation Sections Added**:
1. Per-Domain Collection Architecture (37 lines in README)
2. Migration from Shared Collections (143 lines in README)
3. Architecture Evolution (Phase 1 + Phase 2 in TODO)
4. Updated Database Schema (both README and TODO)
5. Updated API Endpoints documentation

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope for Task 10)

**Vector Migration** (Optional):
- Currently, migration script only creates empty collections
- Existing vectors remain in old shared collections
- Two options for users:
  1. Re-ingest documents (recommended, fresh embeddings)
  2. Manual vector migration (advanced, copy vectors from old to new collections)
- Future enhancement: Add --migrate-vectors flag to script

**Collection Metadata**:
- Could add collection metadata (source_id, created_at, document_count)
- Useful for monitoring and debugging
- Not critical for initial migration

**Monitoring**:
- Could add metrics endpoint for collection counts
- Useful for production monitoring
- Not in scope for this task

---

**Task 10 Implementation Complete** ✅

All requirements from PRP met, documentation comprehensive, migration script production-ready.
