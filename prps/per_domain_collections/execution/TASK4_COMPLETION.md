# Task 4 Implementation Complete: Update IngestionService

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: N/A (PRP execution task)
- **Task Name**: Task 4: Update IngestionService
- **Responsibility**: Update document ingestion to route chunks to per-domain collections instead of shared global collections
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
None - This task only modified existing files.

### Modified Files:
1. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/backend/src/services/ingestion_service.py`** (883 lines total)
   - Updated `ingest_document()` method to read `collection_names` from source (lines 177-202)
   - Modified chunk routing logic to use domain-specific collections (lines 297-377)
   - Enhanced logging to show per-collection storage counts (lines 374-420)
   - Updated docstrings to reflect per-domain collection architecture

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Read collection_names from Source
- Query database to fetch both `enabled_collections` and `collection_names` fields
- Parse JSONB `collection_names` field (handles both string and dict formats)
- Logging shows enabled collections and collection name mappings

#### 2. Domain-Specific Collection Routing
- For each classified chunk type (documents, code, media):
  - Get domain-specific collection name from `collection_names` mapping
  - Skip chunks if no collection_name found (with warning log)
  - Route chunks to domain-specific Qdrant collection (e.g., "AI_Knowledge_documents")

#### 3. Correct Embedding Model per Collection Type
- Uses `settings.COLLECTION_EMBEDDING_MODELS[collection_type]` to get appropriate model
- "documents" → text-embedding-3-small (1536d)
- "code" → text-embedding-3-large (3072d)
- "media" → clip-vit-base-patch32 (512d)

#### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Logs collection_names mapping on source load
- Logs embedding step with model name and domain collection name
- Logs storage step with domain collection name, collection type, model, and document_id
- Final summary includes domain-specific collection names (not just types)

#### 5. Error Handling
- Warns and skips chunks if collection_name not found in mapping
- Tracks failed chunks separately from successfully stored chunks
- Graceful degradation: continues with other collections if one fails

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: collection_names JSONB Parsing
**Issue**: `collection_names` field from asyncpg can be string or dict depending on driver settings.

**Implementation**: Defensive parsing handles both cases:
```python
if isinstance(collection_names_raw, str):
    collection_names = json.loads(collection_names_raw)
elif isinstance(collection_names_raw, dict):
    collection_names = collection_names_raw
else:
    collection_names = {}
```

#### Gotcha #2: Missing collection_names Entry
**Issue**: If source has enabled_collections but collection_names doesn't have corresponding entry.

**Implementation**: Check before routing and skip with warning:
```python
collection_name = collection_names.get(collection_type)
if not collection_name:
    logger.warning(f"No collection_name found for '{collection_type}'...")
    total_chunks_failed += len(chunk_texts)
    continue
```

#### Gotcha #3: Existing _store_document_atomic Already Supports Dynamic Collections
**Implementation**: Leveraged existing `collection_name` parameter in `_store_document_atomic()`:
- No signature changes needed
- Already creates collection-specific VectorService
- Already ensures collection exists before upserting

#### Gotcha #4: EmbeddingBatchResult Pattern Preserved
**Implementation**: Maintained existing pattern for handling partial embedding failures:
- Only store chunks with successful embeddings
- Track `total_chunks_failed` separately
- Continue with other collections if one fails

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 3 COMPLETE**: SourceService returns `collection_names` field from database
  - Verified: `source_service.py` populates `collection_names` during source creation
  - Verified: Database migration 004 adds `collection_names` JSONB column
  - Verified: CollectionManager creates domain-specific Qdrant collections

### External Dependencies:
- asyncpg: Database connection pool (existing dependency)
- settings.COLLECTION_EMBEDDING_MODELS: Configuration mapping (existing)
- settings.COLLECTION_DIMENSIONS: Dimension mapping (existing)
- VectorService: Already supports dynamic collection names (existing)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Services Running):
- [ ] Create source with enabled_collections=["documents", "code"]
- [ ] Verify collection_names populated (e.g., {"documents": "Test_Source_documents", "code": "Test_Source_code"})
- [ ] Upload document to source
- [ ] Check logs for domain collection routing:
  - "Embedding X chunks using Y for domain collection 'Z'"
  - "Stored X chunks in domain collection 'Z' (type=documents, model=...)"
- [ ] Verify chunks stored in domain-specific Qdrant collections (not global AI_DOCUMENTS)
- [ ] Check Qdrant collections list includes source-specific collections
- [ ] Verify per-collection storage counts in logs

### Validation Results:
- Syntax: Python compiles successfully (883 lines, no syntax errors)
- Pattern consistency: Follows existing IngestionService patterns
- Error handling: Comprehensive try/except blocks maintained
- Logging: Enhanced with domain-specific collection information
- Backward compatibility: Graceful handling if collection_names empty/missing

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:
- [x] Reads `collection_names` from source correctly
- [x] Routes chunks to domain-specific collections (not global AI_DOCUMENTS/AI_CODE)
- [x] Uses correct embedding model per collection type
- [x] Logs storage counts per collection with domain collection names
- [x] Error handling comprehensive (missing collection_names, partial failures)

**Code Quality**:
- [x] Comprehensive documentation in docstrings
- [x] Follows existing code patterns (EmbeddingBatchResult, error handling)
- [x] Enhanced logging for debugging (shows collection_names mapping)
- [x] Defensive programming (JSONB parsing, missing keys)
- [x] No breaking changes to existing API signatures

**Key Changes Summary**:
1. **Line 181**: Added `collection_names` to SELECT query
2. **Lines 189-202**: Parse `collection_names` JSONB field
3. **Lines 297-306**: Get domain-specific collection name from mapping
4. **Lines 312-314**: Enhanced logging with domain collection name
5. **Lines 350-377**: Updated storage logging with per-collection details
6. **Lines 390-395**: Track domain-specific collections used (not just types)
