## Task Information
- **Task ID**: N/A (Sequential execution, Group 2)
- **Task Name**: Task 3 - Update SourceService
- **Responsibility**: Integrate CollectionManager into SourceService for collection lifecycle management. When sources are created, automatically create Qdrant collections. When sources are deleted, automatically clean up Qdrant collections.
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

### Modified Files:
1. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/backend/src/services/source_service.py`** (548 lines total, ~150 lines added/modified)
   - Added imports: `AsyncQdrantClient`, `CollectionManager`
   - Updated `__init__()`: Added `qdrant_client` parameter and initialized `CollectionManager`
   - Updated `create_source()`: Creates Qdrant collections and stores `collection_names` in database
   - Updated `get_source()`: Returns `collection_names` field
   - Updated `list_sources()`: Includes `collection_names` in SELECT queries
   - Updated `update_source()`: Returns `collection_names` in RETURNING clause
   - Updated `delete_source()`: Deletes Qdrant collections before database deletion

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. CollectionManager Integration
- **Import**: Added `from .collection_manager import CollectionManager` and `from qdrant_client import AsyncQdrantClient`
- **Initialization**: Modified `__init__` to accept optional `qdrant_client` parameter
- **Pattern**: Optional dependency - if `qdrant_client` is `None`, collection management is gracefully skipped
- **Instance**: Created `self.collection_manager` instance when client is provided

#### 2. create_source() - Collection Creation
- **Step 1**: Insert source into database with empty `collection_names` field
- **Step 2**: Call `CollectionManager.create_collections_for_source()` to create Qdrant collections
- **Step 3**: Update database with `collection_names` mapping (e.g., `{"documents": "AI_Knowledge_documents"}`)
- **Rollback**: If Qdrant collection creation fails, delete source from database (atomic operation)
- **Error Handling**: Returns detailed error with rollback message if collections fail
- **Title Handling**: Extracts source title from `metadata['title']` (defaults to "Untitled")

#### 3. delete_source() - Collection Deletion
- **Step 1**: Fetch source with `collection_names` from database
- **Step 2**: Call `CollectionManager.delete_collections_for_source()` to delete Qdrant collections
- **Step 3**: Delete source from database
- **Graceful Degradation**: Logs errors but continues with database deletion if Qdrant deletion fails
- **Parsing**: Handles `collection_names` as both string (JSON) and dict (asyncpg may return either)

#### 4. get_source() - Return Collection Names
- **Added Field**: Included `collection_names` in SELECT query
- **Response**: Returns `collection_names` mapping in source dict

#### 5. list_sources() - Include Collection Names
- **Both Modes**: Added `collection_names` to both `exclude_large_fields=True` and `exclude_large_fields=False` SELECT queries
- **MCP Optimization**: Preserves existing field truncation logic while adding new field

#### 6. update_source() - Include Collection Names in Response
- **RETURNING Clause**: Added `collection_names` to RETURNING clause
- **No Collection Update**: Current implementation doesn't update collections when `enabled_collections` changes (future enhancement)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Rollback on Collection Creation Failure
**PRP Requirement**: "Handle Qdrant failures gracefully (rollback source creation if collections fail)"

**Implementation**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    # CRITICAL: Rollback database insert if Qdrant collection creation fails
    logger.error(f"Failed to create Qdrant collections for source {source_id}: {e}. Rolling back source creation.")

    # Delete the source from database
    async with self.db_pool.acquire() as conn:
        await conn.execute("DELETE FROM sources WHERE id = $1", source_id)

    return False, {"error": f"Failed to create Qdrant collections: {str(e)}", "detail": "Source creation rolled back"}
```

**Why Critical**: Ensures database and Qdrant remain in sync. Without rollback, source would exist in database without corresponding Qdrant collections, causing ingestion failures.

#### Gotcha #2: Graceful Deletion (Don't Fail on Qdrant Errors)
**PRP Requirement**: "Log any deletion errors but don't fail the delete operation"

**Implementation**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    # Log error but continue with database deletion
    logger.error(f"Failed to delete Qdrant collections for source {source_id}: {e}. Continuing with database deletion.")
# Continues to delete from database
```

**Why Critical**: Qdrant collection may already be deleted manually or Qdrant may be temporarily down. Don't block source deletion - log and continue.

#### Gotcha #3: Optional CollectionManager (Backward Compatibility)
**Design Decision**: Made `qdrant_client` parameter optional in `__init__`

**Implementation**:
```python
def __init__(self, db_pool: asyncpg.Pool, qdrant_client: AsyncQdrantClient | None = None):
    self.db_pool = db_pool
    self.qdrant_client = qdrant_client
    self.collection_manager = CollectionManager(qdrant_client) if qdrant_client else None

# Usage:
if self.collection_manager and enabled_collections:
    collection_names = await self.collection_manager.create_collections_for_source(...)
```

**Why Important**:
- Allows existing API route code to continue working without immediate changes (they pass only `db_pool`)
- Enables gradual rollout - routes can be updated one at a time to pass `qdrant_client`
- Makes testing easier (can test database logic without Qdrant dependency)

#### Gotcha #4: Parse collection_names from JSONB
**Issue**: asyncpg may return JSONB as string or dict depending on context

**Implementation**:
```python
# Parse collection_names from JSONB (could be string or dict)
if isinstance(collection_names_raw, str):
    collection_names = json.loads(collection_names_raw)
elif isinstance(collection_names_raw, dict):
    collection_names = collection_names_raw
else:
    collection_names = {}
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents JSON parsing errors when asyncpg returns dict vs string

#### Gotcha #5: Use Title from Metadata
**PRP Pattern**: Source title comes from `metadata['title']` field

**Implementation**:
```python
source_title = metadata.get("title", "Untitled")
```

**Reference**: Follows existing pattern from `sources.py` API route (line 90-91)

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 1 COMPLETE**: Database migration added `collection_names JSONB` column to sources table
  - Verified: Column exists and is included in all queries
  - Type: JSONB with default `{}`
  - Index: GIN index created for efficient JSON queries

- **Task 2 COMPLETE**: CollectionManager service exists and is fully functional
  - Verified: `src/services/collection_manager.py` exists with 262 lines
  - Methods available:
    - `sanitize_collection_name(source_title, collection_type)` - Static method
    - `create_collections_for_source(source_id, source_title, enabled_collections)` - Returns dict
    - `delete_collections_for_source(collection_names)` - Graceful error handling
  - Pattern: Service accepts `AsyncQdrantClient` in constructor

### External Dependencies:
- **qdrant-client**: Required for `AsyncQdrantClient` import
  - Already in project dependencies (verified by existing CollectionManager)

- **asyncpg**: Already used throughout SourceService
  - Version compatibility: Existing code works, no changes needed

- **Python 3.11+**: Union type syntax (`AsyncQdrantClient | None`)
  - Already project standard

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Services Running):
- [ ] **Test 1: Create source with collections**
  ```bash
  # Start services
  docker-compose up -d

  # Create source via API
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/sources \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "title": "Test Source",
      "source_type": "upload",
      "enabled_collections": ["documents", "code"]
    }'

  # Verify response includes collection_names field
  # Expected: {"documents": "Test_Source_documents", "code": "Test_Source_code"}
  ```

- [ ] **Test 2: Get source returns collection_names**
  ```bash
  # Get source by ID
  curl http://localhost:8001/api/sources/{source_id}

  # Verify response includes collection_names field
  ```

- [ ] **Test 3: List sources includes collection_names**
  ```bash
  # List all sources
  curl http://localhost:8001/api/sources

  # Verify each source has collection_names field
  ```

- [ ] **Test 4: Delete source removes Qdrant collections**
  ```bash
  # Delete source
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8001/api/sources/{source_id}

  # Check Qdrant collections are deleted
  # (Use Qdrant dashboard or API to verify collections removed)
  ```

- [ ] **Test 5: Rollback on collection creation failure**
  ```bash
  # Stop Qdrant service
  docker-compose stop qdrant

  # Try to create source (should fail and rollback)
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/sources \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title": "Test", "source_type": "upload"}'

  # Verify source NOT created in database
  # Expected: Error response with rollback message
  ```

### Total Lines of Code: ~150 lines added/modified (in 548 line file)

**Key Implementation Decisions**:

1. **Optional Dependency Pattern**: Made `qdrant_client` parameter optional to maintain backward compatibility
   - Rationale: Allows existing API routes to work without modification
   - Trade-off: Must update routes separately to enable collection management
   - Benefit: Gradual rollout, easier testing

2. **Rollback on Create Failure**: Delete source from database if Qdrant collection creation fails
   - Rationale: Maintain data consistency between database and Qdrant
   - Pattern: Two-phase commit (insert, then update if collections succeed)
   - Critical: Prevents orphaned sources without collections

3. **Graceful Degradation on Delete**: Log errors but continue deletion if Qdrant fails
   - Rationale: Don't block source deletion if Qdrant is down
   - Pattern: Best-effort cleanup with logging
   - Manual cleanup: Admin can clean orphaned collections later

4. **Parse collection_names Defensively**: Handle both string and dict from asyncpg
   - Rationale: asyncpg JSONB behavior varies by context
   - Pattern: Type check before parsing
   - Fallback: Empty dict if parsing fails

**Next Steps for Integration**:

1. **Update API Routes** (Task dependency for future work):
   - Modify `sources.py` routes to pass `qdrant_client` to SourceService
   - Pattern: `source_service = SourceService(db_pool, qdrant_client)`
   - Location: Lines 94, 183, 286, 411, 509 in `/api/routes/sources.py`

2. **Update Response Models** (Task 7 - API Routes):
   - Add `collection_names` field to `SourceResponse` model
   - Type: `dict[str, str] | None`
   - Location: `src/models/responses.py`

3. **Integration Testing** (Task 9):
   - Test full create → ingest → search → delete flow
   - Verify collections created and deleted correctly
   - Test rollback behavior with Qdrant down

**Ready for integration and next steps.**

**Critical for downstream tasks**:
- Task 4 (IngestionService): Depends on `collection_names` being stored
- Task 7 (API Routes): Must update to pass `qdrant_client` to SourceService
- Task 9 (Integration Tests): Can now test full collection lifecycle
