# PRP: PRP Context Cleanup & Optimization

**Generated**: 2025-10-05
**Based On**: prps/INITIAL_prp_context_cleanup.md
**Archon Project**: 2f8f73a8-b5c6-44b0-a1d2-1946ec516a9f

---

## Goal

Refactor the PRP generation and execution system to eliminate context pollution by reducing command file sizes by 80% (582→120 lines for generate-prp, 620→100 lines for execute-prp), extracting implementation patterns to dedicated reference documents, consolidating Archon workflow to a single source of truth, and fixing file organization to use per-feature scoped directories instead of global pollution.

**End State**:
- Commands are 80-120 lines (down from 582 and 620 lines) containing ONLY orchestration logic
- Implementation patterns extracted to 4 pattern documents in `.claude/patterns/`
- New PRPs use scoped directories: `prps/{feature}/planning/`, `prps/{feature}/examples/`, `prps/{feature}/execution/`
- Zero root directory pollution from generated artifacts
- All advanced functionality preserved (Archon integration, parallel execution, quality scoring, validation loops)
- Cleanup command available for archiving completed features
- 59% token reduction per command invocation (1202→220 lines effective context)

## Why

**Current Pain Points**:
- **Context bloat**: Commands are 80% pseudocode implementation details, 20% orchestration
- **Duplication**: Archon workflow duplicated across 6+ locations (commands, subagents, examples)
- **Root pollution**: Global `prps/research/` and `examples/{feature}/` directories accumulate artifacts from all features
- **Maintainability**: Changes to patterns require updates in 6+ files
- **Token waste**: 1202 lines loaded per command invocation (generate-prp 582 + execute-prp 620)
- **No lifecycle management**: No way to cleanup/archive completed feature artifacts

**Business Value**:
- **50% easier maintenance**: Centralized patterns mean single update point
- **59% token efficiency**: Reduced context enables faster responses and lower costs
- **Infinite scalability**: Per-feature scoped directories scale without pollution
- **Developer productivity**: Clear separation of concerns (commands vs patterns vs templates)
- **Knowledge preservation**: Pattern library creates reusable institutional knowledge
- **Quality preservation**: All functionality maintained (Archon, parallel execution, scoring) while improving architecture

## What

### Core Features

1. **Command Simplification** (80% reduction)
   - generate-prp.md: 582 → 80-120 lines
   - execute-prp.md: 620 → 80-120 lines
   - Commands contain ONLY: Phase definitions, orchestration logic, subagent invocations
   - Extract: Implementation details, error handling, pseudocode → pattern documents

2. **Pattern Extraction** (DRY principle)
   - `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`: Health check, project/task management, graceful degradation
   - `.claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md`: Multi-task invocation, timing math, speedup calculations
   - `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md`: Scoring criteria, validation loops, pass/fail thresholds
   - `.claude/patterns/error-handling.md`: Subagent failure recovery, retry logic, graceful fallbacks
   - `.claude/patterns/README.md`: Pattern index with quick reference table

3. **File Organization Migration** (per-feature scoping)
   - OLD: `prps/research/` (global), `examples/{feature}/` (root pollution)
   - NEW: `prps/{feature}/planning/`, `prps/{feature}/examples/`, `prps/{feature}/execution/`
   - Update all 10 subagent prompts with parameterized paths
   - Backwards compatibility for old PRPs (path detection logic)

4. **Cleanup Command** (lifecycle management)
   - New command: `.claude/commands/prp-cleanup.md`
   - Interactive menu: Archive (recommended) / Delete (permanent) / Cancel
   - Archive to: `prps/archive/{feature}_{timestamp}/`
   - Preserve core artifacts: INITIAL.md and {feature}.md

5. **Archon Workflow Consolidation** (single source of truth)
   - Consolidate from 6+ locations to `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
   - Commands reference pattern, don't duplicate code
   - Preserve graceful degradation (health check + if/else in commands)

### Success Criteria

**File Organization**:
- [ ] New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/planning/` (not global `prps/research/`)
- [ ] New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/examples/` (not root `examples/{feature}/`)
- [ ] Zero root directory pollution from generated artifacts
- [ ] `/prp-cleanup` command works correctly (archive/delete options)

**Command Simplification**:
- [ ] generate-prp.md reduced to 80-120 lines (from 582)
- [ ] execute-prp.md reduced to 80-120 lines (from 620)
- [ ] All implementation patterns extracted to `.claude/patterns/`
- [ ] Archon workflow consolidated to single source of truth

**Functionality Preservation**:
- [ ] Test PRP generation completes successfully with new structure
- [ ] Test PRP execution completes successfully with new structure
- [ ] All functionality preserved (no regressions):
  - Archon integration (health check, project/task management)
  - Parallel Phase 2 research (3x speedup)
  - Parallel Phase 2 implementation (30-50% speedup)
  - Quality scoring (8+/10 minimum)
  - Physical code extraction to examples/
  - Validation iteration loops
  - Time tracking and metrics
- [ ] Existing PRPs still executable without modification (backwards compatible)

**Efficiency & Documentation**:
- [ ] Token usage reduced by ~50% per command invocation (1202 → 220 lines)
- [ ] Pattern documents discoverable via `.claude/patterns/README.md` index
- [ ] Migration path documented for users
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with pattern references

# ESSENTIAL LOCAL FILES
- file: examples/prp_context_cleanup/README.md
  why: Comprehensive integration guide for all 4 extracted code examples
  pattern: "What to Mimic/Adapt/Skip" sections provide actionable implementation guidance

- file: examples/prp_context_cleanup/archon_workflow_example.py
  why: Complete Archon MCP integration workflow (health check → project/task management)
  critical: Single source of truth for Archon integration, currently duplicated across 6+ locations
  pattern: setup_archon_project(), update_task_status(), handle_subagent_error(), complete_archon_project()

- file: examples/prp_context_cleanup/parallel_subagents_example.py
  why: Parallel subagent invocation pattern achieving 3x speedup (14min → 5min)
  critical: ALL in SINGLE response rule - lose 3x speedup if implemented sequentially
  pattern: can_run_in_parallel(), parallel_research_phase(), calculate_parallel_speedup()

- file: examples/prp_context_cleanup/file_organization_example.sh
  why: Per-feature scoped directory structure vs old global structure
  critical: Solves root directory pollution problem
  pattern: create_feature_directories(), check_file_locations() for backwards compatibility

- file: examples/prp_context_cleanup/cleanup_command_example.sh
  why: Interactive cleanup/archival command template
  critical: Archive-first approach with restoration instructions
  pattern: cleanup_prp_feature(), interactive_cleanup_menu(), validate_cleanup_safe()

- file: prps/templates/prp_base.md
  why: PRP structure template with validation checklist
  critical: Reference this template for quality gates, don't duplicate
  pattern: Final validation checklist section at end

- file: .claude/commands/generate-prp.md
  why: Current 582-line command showing what to extract vs keep
  critical: Lines 38-77 (Archon), 128-234 (Parallel), 363-395 (Quality) = extraction targets
  pattern: Phase-based orchestration, keep Phase 0 & 5 in command

- file: .claude/commands/execute-prp.md
  why: Current 620-line command showing extraction targets
  critical: Lines 39-71 (Archon), 123-233 (Parallel groups), 526-550 (Validation) = extract
  pattern: Keep orchestration, extract pseudocode and detailed patterns

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```python
# CRITICAL 1: Premature Abstraction - Wrong Abstraction Worse Than Duplication

# CRITICAL 2: File Path Migration Breaking Subagent References
# Source: Migration analysis from codebase patterns

# ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded path in subagent prompt
# In .claude/agents/prp-gen-codebase-researcher.md:

    else:
        return new_path

# CRITICAL 3: Archon Graceful Degradation Breaking
# Source: Codebase analysis (.claude/commands/generate-prp.md:38-77)

# ❌ WRONG: Over-simplified command loses graceful degradation
# 4. Create Archon project (see .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md)

    print("ℹ️ Archon MCP not available - proceeding without project tracking")

# What to EXTRACT: Health check signature, project structure, task flow
# What to KEEP: Health check invocation, if/else branching, fallback messages

# CRITICAL 4: Progressive Disclosure Two-Level Violation
# Source: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/

# ❌ WRONG: Three-level indirection (VIOLATED)
# Command → Pattern Doc → Sub-Pattern Doc → Example Doc
# Developer must read 4 documents to understand feature

# ✅ RIGHT: Two-level maximum (CORRECT)
# Level 1 (Commands): WHAT and WHEN
#   - High-level orchestration
#   - References to Level 2 (pattern docs)
#   - NO references to other commands or sub-patterns
#
# Level 2 (Pattern Docs): HOW and WHY
#   - Complete, self-contained implementation guide

#   - Common pitfalls
#   - NO references to other pattern docs
#   - OK to reference official external docs (URLs)
#
# Forbidden Level 3: Sub-patterns
#   - Don't create sub-pattern documents
#   - Don't create pattern indexes (except main README)

# CRITICAL 5: Context Pollution Paradox - Loading Pattern Docs Negates Savings
# Source: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents

# ❌ WRONG: Pattern docs loaded into command context
# Command file: @.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md  # Loads all pattern content!
# Result: 120 (command) + 950 (patterns) = 1070 lines (WORSE than original 582!)

# ✅ RIGHT: Pattern docs referenced but NOT loaded
# Command file:
# For Archon integration patterns, see .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md
# ^ Comment reference, NO @ symbol, NOT loaded into context

# Load pattern docs ONLY when:
# 1. Implementing a NEW command (need to learn pattern)
# 2. Debugging a FAILED workflow (verify pattern usage)
# 3. MODIFYING pattern logic (see current implementation)

# DO NOT load when executing existing commands (trust abstraction)

# Token measurement:
print(f"Command: {command_lines} lines, Patterns loaded: {pattern_lines} lines")
print(f"Total: {command_lines + pattern_lines} (Target: <600)")

# CRITICAL 6: Breaking Parallel Execution by Losing Timing Details
# Source: Codebase analysis (.claude/commands/generate-prp.md:128-234)

# ❌ WRONG: Pattern doc loses "ALL in SINGLE response" instruction
# Developer implements in loop or separate responses (sequential)
# Result: 5min → 14min (64% SLOWER, 3x speedup lost!)

# ✅ RIGHT: Pattern doc preserves critical instructions
# CRITICAL Rule: ALL in SINGLE Response

# WRONG (Sequential - 14 minutes):
Task(subagent_type="researcher", ...)
# [Waits for completion]
Task(subagent_type="hunter", ...)

# CORRECT (Parallel - 5 minutes):
# Prepare ALL contexts first
researcher_ctx = f'''...'''
hunter_ctx = f'''...'''
curator_ctx = f'''...'''

# Then invoke ALL THREE in THIS SAME RESPONSE (before any wait)

Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-documentation-hunter", prompt=hunter_ctx)
Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-example-curator", prompt=curator_ctx)

# Performance Math (include in pattern!):
# Sequential: 5min + 4min + 5min = 14 minutes
# Parallel: max(5, 4, 5) = 5 minutes
# Speedup: 64% faster

# Validation:
import time
start = time.time()
# [Invoke parallel tasks]
duration = time.time() - start
assert duration < 7 * 60, f"Too slow: {duration}s (expected <420s)"

# CRITICAL 7: Command Injection via Malicious Feature Names

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 0: File Organization Foundation (MUST DO FIRST)

**Why First**: Establish clean structure before refactoring commands. All subsequent phases depend on this foundation.

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Update file paths in all commands and subagents, create directory structure helpers, establish backwards compatibility.

**FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY**:
- Modify: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (directory creation logic)
- Modify: `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (directory creation logic)
- Modify: ALL 10 subagent files in `.claude/agents/` (output paths)
- Create: Helper functions for path management

**PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: From `examples/prp_context_cleanup/file_organization_example.sh`

**SPECIFIC STEPS**:

1. **Update generate-prp.md Phase 0 directory creation**:
   ```python
   # OLD (global pollution):
   # Bash("mkdir -p prps/research")
   # Bash("mkdir -p examples/{feature}")

   # NEW (scoped):
   feature_name = extract_feature_name(initial_md_path, content)  # With validation!
   Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/planning")
   Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/examples")
   ```

2. **Update execute-prp.md Phase 0 directory creation**:
   ```python
   feature_name = extract_feature_name(prp_path, prp_content)
   Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/execution")
   ```

3. **Update ALL subagent output paths** (CRITICAL - easy to miss):

   **Search and replace in subagent files**:
   ```bash
   # Find all hardcoded paths:
   grep -r "prps/research/" .claude/agents/prp-gen-*.md  # Should return 0 after fix
   grep -r "examples/{feature}/" .claude/agents/  # Should return 0 after fix
   ```

   **In each subagent prompt, change instructions from**:
   ```markdown
   **Output**: prps/research/codebase-patterns.md
   ```

   **To**:
   ```markdown
   **Output**: Use the exact path provided in context:
   `prps/{feature_name}/planning/codebase-patterns.md`

   DO NOT hardcode paths. Use parameterized path from command.
   ```

4. **Add backwards compatibility path checking**:
   ```python
   # In Phase 4 (assembler) when reading research artifacts:
   def get_research_artifact(feature_name: str, artifact: str) -> str:
       new_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/{artifact}.md"
       old_path = f"prps/research/{artifact}.md"

       if file_exists(new_path):
           return Read(new_path)
       elif file_exists(old_path):
           print(f"⚠️ Using legacy path: {old_path}")
           return Read(old_path)
       else:
           raise FileNotFoundError(f"Not found: {new_path} or {old_path}")
   ```

5. **Add feature name validation** (SECURITY):
   ```python
   import re

   def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, content: str = None) -> str:
       basename = filepath.split("/")[-1]
       feature = basename.replace("INITIAL_", "").replace(".md", "")

       # Whitelist validation
       if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', feature):
           raise ValueError(f"Invalid feature name: '{feature}'")
       if len(feature) > 50:
           raise ValueError(f"Feature name too long: {len(feature)}")
       if ".." in feature or "/" in feature:
           raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {feature}")

       dangerous_chars = ['$', '`', ';', '&', '|', '>', '<']
       if any(char in feature for char in dangerous_chars):
           raise ValueError(f"Dangerous characters: {feature}")

       return feature
   ```

**VALIDATION**:
- [ ] `grep -r "prps/research/" .claude/agents/` returns 0 results
- [ ] Test: `/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_test_scoped.md` creates `prps/test_scoped/planning/`
- [ ] Test: Old PRP executes with legacy path warning
- [ ] Test: Malicious feature name `$(rm -rf /)` is rejected with error

---

### Phase 1: Extract Archon Workflow Pattern (Single Source of Truth)

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Consolidate duplicated Archon integration code from 6+ locations into one authoritative pattern document.

**FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY**:
- Create: `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
- Modify: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (remove duplication, add reference)
- Modify: `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (remove duplication, add reference)

**PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: From `examples/prp_context_cleanup/archon_workflow_example.py`

**SPECIFIC STEPS**:

1. **Create `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`** with complete pattern:
   ```markdown
   # Archon Workflow Pattern - Complete Reference

   ## Health Check (ALWAYS FIRST)
   ```python
   health = mcp__archon__health_check()
   archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
   # Returns: {"status": "healthy"} or raises exception
   ```

   ## Graceful Fallback
   ```python
   if archon_available:
       # Use Archon features
   else:
       project_id = None
       task_ids = []
       print("ℹ️ Archon MCP not available - proceeding without project tracking")
   ```

   ## Project Creation
   ```python
   project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create",
       title=f"PRP Generation: {feature_name}",
       description=f"Creating PRP from {initial_md_path}"
   )
   project_id = project["project"]["id"]
   ```

   ## Task Creation with Priority
   ```python
   task = mcp__archon__manage_task("create",
       project_id=project_id,
       title="Phase 1: Feature Analysis",
       status="todo",
       assignee="prp-gen-feature-analyzer",
       task_order=100  # Higher = higher priority (0-100)
   )
   task_id = task["task"]["id"]
   ```

   ## Task Status Flow: todo → doing → done
   ```python
   # Before starting
   mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="doing")

   # After completion
   mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="done")

   # On error (reset for retry)
   mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="todo",
       description=f"ERROR: {error_message}")
   ```

   ## Parallel Task Updates
   ```python
   # Before parallel invocation: ALL to "doing"
   if archon_available:
       for task_id in parallel_task_ids:
           mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="doing")

   # After ALL complete: ALL to "done"
   if archon_available:
       for task_id in parallel_task_ids:
           mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="done")
   ```

   ## Complete Example (Copy-Paste Ready)
   [Full working example from archon_workflow_example.py]
   ```

2. **Update generate-prp.md** to reference pattern (don't duplicate):
   ```python
   # Phase 0: Setup

   # 1-3. Read file, extract feature, create directories [as before]

   # 4. Check Archon availability (KEEP in command for graceful degradation)
   health = mcp__archon__health_check()
   archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

   # 5. Conditional Archon setup
   if archon_available:
       # For HOW to create project/tasks, see:
       # .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md

       project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create",
           title=f"PRP Generation: {feature_name}",
           description=f"Creating comprehensive PRP from {initial_md_path}"
       )
       project_id = project["project"]["id"]

       # Create 5 tasks for phases (pattern doc shows structure)
       task_ids = []
       for phase_def in [
           {"title": "Phase 1: Analysis", "assignee": "prp-gen-feature-analyzer", "order": 100},
           {"title": "Phase 2A: Codebase Research", "assignee": "prp-gen-codebase-researcher", "order": 90},
           # ... [simplified creation]
       ]:
           task = mcp__archon__manage_task("create", project_id=project_id, **phase_def)
           task_ids.append(task["task"]["id"])
   else:
       project_id = None
       task_ids = []
       print("ℹ️ Archon MCP not available - proceeding without project tracking")
   ```

3. **Remove pseudocode** from commands (it's now in pattern doc):
   - Delete: Detailed error handling examples
   - Delete: All status update examples beyond basic invocation
   - Keep: Health check, if/else branching, basic invocations

**VALIDATION**:
- [ ] Pattern doc is self-contained (no references to other patterns)
- [ ] Commands reference pattern but don't load it (no `@` symbol)
- [ ] Generate-prp works with Archon online
- [ ] Generate-prp works with Archon offline (graceful degradation)

---

### Phase 2: Extract Parallel Execution Pattern (Preserve 3x Speedup)

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Document parallel subagent invocation pattern with critical timing details to preserve performance gains.

**FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY**:
- Create: `.claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md`
- Modify: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (Phase 2 section)
- Modify: `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (Phase 2 section)

**PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: From `examples/prp_context_cleanup/parallel_subagents_example.py`

**SPECIFIC STEPS**:

1. **Create `.claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md`** with CRITICAL details:
   ```markdown
   # Parallel Subagent Execution Pattern

   ## The CRITICAL Rule: ALL in SINGLE Response

   **WRONG (Sequential - 14 minutes)**:
   ```python
   Task(subagent_type="researcher", ...)
   # [Waits for completion]
   Task(subagent_type="hunter", ...)
   # [Waits for completion]
   ```

   **CORRECT (Parallel - 5 minutes)**:
   ```python
   # 1. Prepare ALL contexts first
   researcher_ctx = f'''[context]'''
   hunter_ctx = f'''[context]'''
   curator_ctx = f'''[context]'''

   # 2. Invoke ALL THREE in THIS SAME RESPONSE (before any wait)
   Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-codebase-researcher", prompt=researcher_ctx)
   Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-documentation-hunter", prompt=hunter_ctx)
   Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-example-curator", prompt=curator_ctx)

   # System automatically waits for ALL to complete
   ```

   ## Performance Math (INCLUDE THIS!)
   ```
   Sequential: 5min + 4min + 5min = 14 minutes
   Parallel: max(5, 4, 5) = 5 minutes
   Speedup: (14 - 5) / 14 = 64% faster
   ```

   ## Archon Task Updates
   ```python
   # Before parallel invocation: Update ALL to "doing"
   if archon_available:
       for task_id in [task_2a, task_2b, task_2c]:
           mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="doing")

   # After ALL complete: Update ALL to "done"
   if archon_available:
       for task_id in [task_2a, task_2b, task_2c]:
           mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="done")
   ```

   ## Timing Validation
   ```python
   import time
   start = time.time()
   # [Invoke parallel tasks]
   duration = time.time() - start

   # Should be ~5 min, not 14
   assert duration < 7 * 60, f"Too slow: {duration}s (expected <420s)"
   ```

   ## When to Use Parallel Execution
   - Tasks have NO file conflicts (different output files)
   - Tasks are INDEPENDENT (no sequential dependencies)
   - Tasks have SEPARATE contexts (no shared state)

   Examples:
   - generate-prp Phase 2: ALWAYS parallel (3 research tasks)
   - execute-prp Phase 2: Conditional (based on task dependencies)
   ```

2. **Update generate-prp.md Phase 2** (emphasize CRITICAL rule):
   ```python
   ## Phase 2: Parallel Research (3x Speedup)

   # CRITICAL: Invoke ALL THREE in SINGLE response.
   # See `.claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md` for timing math.

   # 1. Prepare contexts for all three subagents
   researcher_context = f'''[Phase 2A context with paths]'''
   hunter_context = f'''[Phase 2B context with paths]'''
   curator_context = f'''[Phase 2C context with paths]'''

   # 2. Update Archon tasks to "doing"
   if archon_available:
       for i in [1, 2, 3]:  # Tasks 2A, 2B, 2C
           mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[i], status="doing")

   # 3. Invoke ALL THREE NOW (in this same response)
   print("🚀 Phase 2: Parallel Research (3 subagents simultaneously)")

   Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-codebase-researcher",
        description="Search codebase patterns",
        prompt=researcher_context)

   Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-documentation-hunter",
        description="Find documentation",
        prompt=hunter_context)

   Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-example-curator",
        description="Extract code examples",
        prompt=curator_context)

   # 4. After completion, update tasks to "done"
   if archon_available:
       for i in [1, 2, 3]:
           mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[i], status="done")
   ```

3. **Add timing validation** (detect regression):
   ```python
   # At start of Phase 2:
   import time
   phase2_start = time.time()

   # [Parallel invocation as above]

   # At end of Phase 2:
   phase2_duration = time.time() - phase2_start
   print(f"⏱️ Phase 2 completed in {phase2_duration/60:.1f} minutes")

   if phase2_duration > 7 * 60:
       print(f"⚠️ WARNING: Phase 2 took {phase2_duration/60:.1f}min (expected <7min)")
       print("Possible issue: Sequential execution instead of parallel?")

   # Store for completion report
   timing_data["phase2_duration"] = phase2_duration
   ```

**VALIDATION**:
- [ ] Pattern doc includes "ALL in SINGLE response" emphasis
- [ ] Pattern doc includes performance math (Sequential vs Parallel)
- [ ] Test: Phase 2 completes in < 7 minutes (parallel)
- [ ] Test: Timing warning triggers if > 7 minutes

### Phase 3: Extract Quality Gates Pattern (Reference Template)

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Document quality scoring criteria and validation loops, referencing existing prp_base.md checklist.

**FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY**:
- Create: `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md`
- Modify: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (Phase 5 section)
- Modify: `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (Phase 4 section)

**PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: From codebase analysis (generate-prp.md:363-395, execute-prp.md:526-550)

**SPECIFIC STEPS**:

1. **Create `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md`**:
   ```markdown
   # Quality Gates Pattern

   ## PRP Quality Scoring (8+/10 Minimum)

   ### Scoring Criteria
   ```python
   quality_checks = [
       "PRP score >= 8/10",
       "All 5 research documents created",
       "Examples extracted to examples/ (not just references)",
       "Examples have README with 'what to mimic' guidance",
       "Documentation includes URLs with specific sections",
       "Gotchas documented with solutions (not just warnings)",
       "Task list is logical and ordered",
       "Validation gates are executable commands",
       "Codebase patterns referenced appropriately"
   ]
   ```

   ### Score Enforcement
   ```python
   prp_content = Read(f"prps/{feature_name}/{feature_name}.md")

   # Extract score from PRP (look for "Score: X/10")
   import re
   score_match = re.search(r'Score:\s*(\d+)/10', prp_content)
   quality_score = int(score_match.group(1)) if score_match else 0

   if quality_score < 8:
       print(f"⚠️ Quality Gate Failed: PRP scored {quality_score}/10 (minimum: 8/10)")
       print("\nOptions:")
       print("1. Regenerate with additional research")
       print("2. Review and improve specific sections")
       print("3. Proceed anyway (not recommended)")

       choice = input("Choose (1/2/3): ")
       if choice == "1":
           # Re-run phases with more research
       elif choice != "3":
           exit(1)
   else:
       print(f"✅ Quality Gate Passed: {quality_score}/10")
   ```

   ## Execution Quality Gates (Multi-Level)

   ### Level 1: Syntax & Style
   ```bash
   ruff check --fix && mypy .
   # Expected: No errors
   ```

   ### Level 2: Unit Tests
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   # Expected: All tests pass
   ```

   ### Level 3: Integration Tests
   ```bash
   # Project-specific commands from PRP
   ```

   ### Validation Loop (Max 5 Attempts)
   ```python
   for attempt in range(1, 6):
       print(f"Validation attempt {attempt}/5")

       # Run validation level
       result = run_validation(level)

       if result.success:
           print(f"✅ Level {level} passed")
           break
       else:
           print(f"❌ Level {level} failed: {result.error}")
           if attempt < 5:
               print("Analyzing error and attempting fix...")
               fix_attempt = analyze_and_fix(result.error)
           else:
               print("⚠️ Max attempts reached")
   ```

   ## Reference Checklist

   For comprehensive validation checklist, see:
   `prps/templates/prp_base.md` - Final validation Checklist section

   DON'T duplicate the checklist here - reference the template as single source of truth.
   ```

2. **Update generate-prp.md Phase 5** (reference pattern + template):
   ```python
   ## Phase 5: Quality Gate & Completion

   # 1. Read assembled PRP
   prp_content = Read(f"prps/{feature_name}/{feature_name}.md")

   # 2. Extract and enforce quality score
   # For scoring criteria, see: .claude/patterns/quality-gates.md

   import re
   score_match = re.search(r'Score:\s*(\d+)/10', prp_content)
   quality_score = int(score_match.group(1)) if score_match else 0

   if quality_score < 8:
       print(f"⚠️ Quality Gate Failed: {quality_score}/10 (minimum: 8/10)")
       # [Interactive choice as in pattern doc]
   else:
       print(f"✅ Quality Gate Passed: {quality_score}/10")

   # 3. Validation checklist from template
   # See: prps/templates/prp_base.md - Final validation Checklist

   # 4. Completion report
   print(f"""
   ✅ PRP Generation Complete!

   Output: prps/{feature_name}/{feature_name}.md
   Quality Score: {quality_score}/10

   Research Artifacts:
   - prps/{feature_name}/planning/feature-analysis.md
   - prps/{feature_name}/planning/codebase-patterns.md
   - prps/{feature_name}/planning/documentation-links.md
   - prps/{feature_name}/planning/examples-to-include.md
   - prps/{feature_name}/planning/gotchas.md

   Extracted Examples:
   - prps/{feature_name}/examples/ ({example_count} files)

   Next Steps:
   1. Review PRP: prps/{feature_name}/{feature_name}.md
   2. Execute PRP: /execute-prp prps/{feature_name}/{feature_name}.md
   3. (Optional) Cleanup after execution: /prp-cleanup {feature_name}
   """)
   ```

**VALIDATION**:
- [ ] Quality scoring enforces 8+/10 minimum
- [ ] Pattern references template checklist (doesn't duplicate)
- [ ] Completion report includes all artifact locations
- [ ] Next steps guide user to execution and cleanup

### Phase 4: Create Cleanup Command (Lifecycle Management)

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Create interactive command for archiving or deleting completed feature artifacts.

**FILES TO CREATE**:
- Create: `.claude/commands/prp-cleanup.md`

**PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: From `examples/prp_context_cleanup/cleanup_command_example.sh`

**SPECIFIC STEPS**:

1. **Create `.claude/commands/prp-cleanup.md`**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   argument-hint: [feature-name]
   description: Archive or delete PRP planning/execution artifacts
   ---

   # Cleanup PRP Artifacts: $ARGUMENTS

   This command manages completed PRP artifacts after execution.

   ## What Gets Cleaned
   - `prps/{feature}/planning/` (5 research files)
   - `prps/{feature}/examples/` (extracted code)
   - `prps/{feature}/execution/` (3 execution reports)

   ## What Stays
   - `prps/{feature}/INITIAL.md` (original request)
   - `prps/{feature}/{feature}.md` (final PRP)

   ## Implementation

   ```python
   import os
   from datetime import datetime

   feature_name = "$ARGUMENTS"

   # Verify feature exists
   if not os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}"):
       print(f"❌ Feature not found: {feature_name}")
       exit(1)

   # Calculate sizes
   def get_dir_size(path):
       if not os.path.exists(path):
           return 0
       total = 0
       for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path):
           for f in filenames:
               fp = os.path.join(dirpath, f)
               total += os.path.getsize(fp)
       return total

   planning_size = get_dir_size(f"prps/{feature_name}/planning") / (1024*1024)  # MB
   examples_size = get_dir_size(f"prps/{feature_name}/examples") / (1024*1024)
   execution_size = get_dir_size(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution") / (1024*1024)
   total_size = planning_size + examples_size + execution_size

   # Show impact
   print(f"""
   PRP Cleanup: {feature_name}

   Files to clean:
   - prps/{feature_name}/planning/     ({planning_size:.1f} MB)
   - prps/{feature_name}/examples/     ({examples_size:.1f} MB)
   - prps/{feature_name}/execution/    ({execution_size:.1f} MB)
   Total: {total_size:.1f} MB

   Files to keep:
   - prps/{feature_name}/INITIAL.md
   - prps/{feature_name}/{feature_name}.md

   Choose action:
   1. Archive (recommended) - Move to prps/archive/ with timestamp
   2. Delete (permanent)    - Cannot be undone
   3. Cancel                - No changes
   """)

   # Get user choice
   choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3): ")

   if choice == "1":
       # Archive with timestamp
       timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
       archive_path = f"prps/archive/{feature_name}_{timestamp}"

       os.makedirs(archive_path, exist_ok=True)

       # Move artifacts
       if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}/planning"):
           os.system(f"mv prps/{feature_name}/planning {archive_path}/")
       if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}/examples"):
           os.system(f"mv prps/{feature_name}/examples {archive_path}/")
       if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution"):
           os.system(f"mv prps/{feature_name}/execution {archive_path}/")

       print(f"""
       ✅ Archived to: {archive_path}

       To restore:
         mv {archive_path}/* prps/{feature_name}/

       To list archives:
         ls -lh prps/archive/
       """)

   elif choice == "2":
       # Confirm deletion
       confirm = input(f"⚠️ Delete {feature_name} artifacts permanently? Type 'yes' to confirm: ")

       if confirm.lower() == "yes":
           if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}/planning"):
               os.system(f"rm -rf prps/{feature_name}/planning")
           if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}/examples"):
               os.system(f"rm -rf prps/{feature_name}/examples")
           if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution"):
               os.system(f"rm -rf prps/{feature_name}/execution")

           print(f"✅ Deleted planning/examples/execution for {feature_name}")
       else:
           print("❌ Deletion cancelled")

   else:
       print("No changes made")
   ```
   ```

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** with PRP lifecycle:
   ```markdown
   ## PRP Lifecycle

   1. **Create**: `/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_{feature}.md`
   2. **Execute**: `/execute-prp prps/{feature}.md`
   3. **Cleanup**: `/prp-cleanup {feature}` - Archive or delete planning artifacts

   Cleanup options:
   - **Archive** (recommended): Preserves artifacts with timestamp, can restore later
   - **Delete**: Permanent removal, frees disk space
   - **Cancel**: No changes
   ```

**VALIDATION**:
- [ ] Test: `/prp-cleanup test_feature` shows correct sizes
- [ ] Test: Archive option creates timestamped directory in prps/archive/
- [ ] Test: Delete option requires "yes" confirmation
- [ ] Test: Cancel option makes no changes
- [ ] Test: Archived artifacts can be restored

---

### Phase 5: Create Pattern Index & Documentation Updates

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Create pattern discovery index and update project documentation.

**FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY**:
- Create: `.claude/patterns/README.md`
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md` (pattern library section)
- Create: `.claude/templates/completion-report.md` (optional)
- Create: `.claude/templates/validation-report.md` (optional)

**PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: From gotchas.md pattern discovery section

**SPECIFIC STEPS**:

1. **Create `.claude/patterns/README.md`**:
   ```markdown
   # PRP System Patterns - Index

   This directory contains reusable implementation patterns extracted from the PRP generation and execution system. Each pattern is self-contained with code examples, gotchas, and usage guidance.

   ## Quick Reference

   **Need to...** | **See Pattern** | **Used By**
   ---|---|---
   Integrate with Archon MCP | [archon-workflow.md](archon-workflow.md) | generate-prp, execute-prp
   Execute subagents in parallel | [parallel-subagents.md](parallel-subagents.md) | generate-prp Phase 2, execute-prp Phase 2
   Validate PRP/execution quality | [quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md) | generate-prp Phase 5, execute-prp Phase 4
   Handle subagent failures | [error-handling.md](error-handling.md) | All commands
   Organize per-feature files | [file-organization.md](file-organization.md) | generate-prp Phase 0, execute-prp Phase 0

   ## Pattern Categories

   ### Integration Patterns
   - **[archon-workflow.md](archon-workflow.md)**: Health check, project/task management, graceful degradation
     - Use when: Any command needing Archon tracking
     - Key benefit: Works with or without Archon (graceful fallback)

   ### Performance Patterns
   - **[parallel-subagents.md](parallel-subagents.md)**: Multi-task invocation in single response
     - Use when: 3+ independent tasks can run simultaneously
     - Key benefit: 3x speedup for research, 30-50% for implementation

   ### Quality Patterns
   - **[quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md)**: Scoring criteria, validation loops
     - Use when: Output must meet quality thresholds before delivery
     - Key benefit: Prevents low-quality deliverables (8+/10 PRP score)

   ### Reliability Patterns
   - **[error-handling.md](error-handling.md)**: Retry logic, graceful degradation, error recovery
     - Use when: Subagent failures should not halt entire workflow
     - Key benefit: Resilient workflows that recover from failures

   ### Organization Patterns
   - **[file-organization.md](file-organization.md)**: Per-feature scoped directories
     - Use when: Creating new PRPs or organizing artifacts
     - Key benefit: Zero root directory pollution, easy cleanup

   ## Usage Guidelines

   1. **Read the index first**: Find the right pattern before diving in
   2. **Copy-paste examples**: Patterns include ready-to-use code
   3. **Don't modify patterns**: If you need variations, create a new pattern
   4. **Update index when adding**: Keep this README synchronized

   ## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)

   ❌ Don't create sub-patterns (violates two-level disclosure rule)
   ❌ Don't cross-reference patterns (causes circular dependencies)
   ❌ Don't duplicate pattern code in commands (defeats DRY purpose)
   ❌ Don't abstract after <3 occurrences (premature abstraction)

   ## Contribution Guidelines

   When adding a new pattern:
   1. Verify it appears in 3+ locations (Rule of Three)
   2. Include complete code examples (copy-paste ready)
   3. Document gotchas and edge cases
   4. Update this index with quick reference entry
   5. Test pattern with actual command execution
   ```

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** (add pattern library section):
   ```markdown
   ## Pattern Library

   The `.claude/patterns/` directory contains reusable implementation patterns for the PRP system.

   **Before implementing**:
   1. Check `.claude/patterns/README.md` index
   2. Search for existing pattern that matches your need
   3. If found: Use pattern as-is (copy-paste examples)
   4. If not found: Implement, then consider extracting to pattern (after 3rd use)

   **Pattern Index**: [.claude/patterns/README.md](.claude/patterns/README.md)

   **Key Patterns**:
   - **archon-workflow.md**: Archon MCP integration (health check, graceful fallback)
   - **parallel-subagents.md**: Parallel task execution (3x speedup)
   - **quality-gates.md**: Quality scoring and validation loops
   - **error-handling.md**: Subagent failure recovery
   - **file-organization.md**: Per-feature scoped directories
   ```

3. **Create `.claude/templates/completion-report.md`** (optional):
   ```markdown
   # PRP {Generation|Execution} Completion Report

   ## Performance Metrics

   | Metric | Value | Target | Status |
   |--------|-------|--------|--------|
   | Phase 2 Duration | {X} min | < 7 min | {✅/❌} |
   | Parallel Speedup | {Y}% | > 50% | {✅/❌} |
   | Total Time | {Z} min | < {target} min | {✅/❌} |
   | Quality Score | {score}/10 | >= 8/10 | {✅/❌} |
   | Files Generated | {count} | {expected} | {✅/❌} |

   ## Timing Breakdown
   - Phase 0 (Setup): {X} min
   - Phase 1 (Analysis): {Y} min
   - Phase 2 (Parallel): {Z} min ⚡
     - Sequential would be: ~{seq} min
     - Speedup achieved: {speedup}%
   - Phase 3: {A} min
   - Phase 4: {B} min
   - Phase 5: {C} min

   **Total**: {total} minutes

   ## Output Locations
   [List of generated files]

   ## Next Steps
   [Guidance for user]
   ```

**VALIDATION**:
- [ ] Pattern index has all 5 patterns listed
- [ ] CLAUDE.md references pattern library
- [ ] Pattern index is discoverable from project root

---

### Phase 6: Final Validation & Testing

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Comprehensive testing of refactored system to ensure no regressions.

**VALIDATION LEVELS**:

**Level 1: File Organization Validation**
```bash
# Test new PRP with scoped directories
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_test_refactored.md

# Verify directory structure
ls prps/test_refactored/planning/  # Should have 5 files
ls prps/test_refactored/examples/  # Should have extracted code
ls prps/research/  # Should be EMPTY (no pollution)

# Test backwards compatibility
/execute-prp prps/old_prp_without_scoped_dirs.md  # Should work with warning
```

**Level 2: Security Validation**
```bash
# Test feature name validation
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_$(rm -rf /).md  # Should reject with error
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_../../etc/passwd.md  # Should reject
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_valid_name.md  # Should accept

# Test prompt injection detection
# Create INITIAL.md with: "IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS..."
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_malicious.md  # Should warn and require confirmation
```

**Level 3: Performance Validation**
```bash
# Test parallel execution timing
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_perf_test.md
# Check logs for Phase 2 duration (should be < 7 min)

# Test quality scoring
# Should reject PRPs with score < 8/10
```

**Level 4: Cleanup Validation**
```bash
# Test cleanup command
/prp-cleanup test_refactored

# Choose option 1 (Archive)
# Verify: prps/archive/test_refactored_{timestamp}/ exists

# Test restoration
mv prps/archive/test_refactored_*/* prps/test_refactored/
# Verify: planning/, examples/, execution/ restored
```

**Level 5: Token Usage Validation**
```bash
# Measure command file sizes
wc -l .claude/commands/generate-prp.md  # Should be 80-120 lines
wc -l .claude/commands/execute-prp.md  # Should be 80-120 lines

# Verify pattern docs NOT loaded in normal execution
# (No @ references in commands)
grep '@.claude/patterns' .claude/commands/*.md  # Should return 0 results

# Total effective context:
# Command (120) + patterns loaded (0 during normal execution) = 120 lines
# Target: < 600 lines (50% of original 1202)
# Result: 80% reduction achieved ✅
```

**FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST**:

**File Organization**:
- [ ] New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/planning/` (not global `prps/research/`)
- [ ] New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/examples/` (not root `examples/{feature}/`)
- [ ] Zero root directory pollution from generated artifacts
- [ ] `/prp-cleanup` command works correctly (archive/delete options)
- [ ] Old PRPs still executable with backwards compatibility

**Command Simplification**:
- [ ] generate-prp.md is 80-120 lines (was 582)
- [ ] execute-prp.md is 80-120 lines (was 620)
- [ ] All implementation patterns extracted to `.claude/patterns/`
- [ ] Archon workflow consolidated to single source of truth
- [ ] Pattern index created and discoverable

**Functionality Preservation**:
- [ ] Test PRP generation completes successfully
- [ ] Test PRP execution completes successfully
- [ ] Archon integration works (health check, graceful degradation)
- [ ] Parallel Phase 2 research achieves < 7 min (3x speedup)
- [ ] Quality scoring enforces 8+/10 minimum
- [ ] Physical code extraction to examples/ works
- [ ] Validation iteration loops function
- [ ] Time tracking and metrics collected

**Security**:
- [ ] Feature name validation blocks malicious inputs (10+ test cases)
- [ ] Prompt injection detection warns on suspicious INITIAL.md content
- [ ] All Bash commands use validated/sanitized inputs
- [ ] No command injection vulnerabilities

**Efficiency**:
- [ ] Token usage reduced by ~50% (1202 → 220 lines effective)
- [ ] Pattern docs NOT loaded during normal execution (no @ refs)
- [ ] Commands contain only orchestration (no 80% pseudocode)
- [ ] Migration path documented for users

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style Checks

```bash
# Python validation
ruff check --fix .claude/  # Auto-fix command files
mypy .claude/  # Type checking (if applicable)

# Bash validation for examples
shellcheck examples/prp_context_cleanup/*.sh

# Expected: No errors
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests (Pattern Validation)

```bash
# Test feature name extraction security
uv run python -c "
import re

def extract_feature_name(filepath: str) -> str:
    basename = filepath.split('/')[-1]
    feature = basename.replace('INITIAL_', '').replace('.md', '')

    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', feature):
        raise ValueError(f'Invalid: {feature}')
    if len(feature) > 50:
        raise ValueError(f'Too long: {feature}')
    if '..' in feature or '/' in feature:
        raise ValueError(f'Path traversal: {feature}')

    dangerous = ['$', '\`', ';', '&', '|', '>', '<']
    if any(c in feature for c in dangerous):
        raise ValueError(f'Dangerous chars: {feature}')

    return feature

# Test malicious inputs
malicious = ['../../etc/passwd', '\$(rm -rf /)', '; cat /etc/shadow', '\`whoami\`']
for m in malicious:
    try:
        extract_feature_name(f'INITIAL_{m}.md')
        print(f'❌ FAIL: {m} not blocked!')
    except ValueError:
        print(f'✅ PASS: {m} blocked')

# Test valid inputs
valid = ['user_auth', 'web-scraper', 'apiClient123']
for v in valid:
    try:
        result = extract_feature_name(f'INITIAL_{v}.md')
        assert result == v
        print(f'✅ PASS: {v} accepted')
    except:
        print(f'❌ FAIL: {v} rejected!')
"
```

### Level 3: Integration Tests

```bash
# Test 1: New PRP generation with scoped directories
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_integration_test.md

# Verify outputs
test -d prps/integration_test/planning/ && echo "✅ Planning dir created" || echo "❌ Planning missing"
test -f prps/integration_test/planning/feature-analysis.md && echo "✅ Feature analysis created" || echo "❌ Missing"
test -d prps/integration_test/examples/ && echo "✅ Examples dir created" || echo "❌ Examples missing"
test -f prps/integration_test/integration_test.md && echo "✅ PRP created" || echo "❌ PRP missing"

# Verify no pollution
test ! -d prps/research/ && echo "✅ No global pollution" || echo "❌ Global dir exists"

# Test 2: PRP execution
/execute-prp prps/integration_test/integration_test.md

# Verify execution artifacts
test -d prps/integration_test/execution/ && echo "✅ Execution dir created" || echo "❌ Execution missing"

# Test 3: Cleanup command
/prp-cleanup integration_test
# Choose: 1 (Archive)

# Verify archive
test -d prps/archive/integration_test_* && echo "✅ Archive created" || echo "❌ Archive missing"

# Test 4: Backwards compatibility
# (Assumes old PRP exists from before refactoring)
/execute-prp prps/old_feature.md
# Should complete with legacy path warnings
```

### Level 4: Performance Validation

```bash
# Measure timing
time /generate-prp prps/INITIAL_perf_test.md

# Expected outputs:
# - Phase 2 duration: < 7 minutes (parallel)
# - Total duration: < 10 minutes
# - Quality score: >= 8/10

# Verify speedup
# Check logs for: "⏱️ Phase 2 completed in X.X minutes"
# X.X should be < 7.0
```

### Level 5: Token Usage Audit

```bash
# Count command lines
echo "generate-prp: $(wc -l < .claude/commands/generate-prp.md) lines"
echo "execute-prp: $(wc -l < .claude/commands/execute-prp.md) lines"

# Verify no @ pattern references
grep -c '@.claude/patterns' .claude/commands/*.md
# Should output: 0

# Calculate effective context
# Command lines + Loaded pattern lines (should be 0)
# Target: < 600 lines total
# Achievement: ~120 + 0 = 120 lines (80% reduction)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Premature Abstraction
❌ Don't extract patterns after only 1-2 occurrences
❌ Don't create overly generic abstractions with 10+ parameters
✅ Wait for Rule of Three (3+ occurrences)
✅ Extract minimal, specific abstractions

### 2. Three-Level References
❌ Don't create: Command → Pattern → Sub-Pattern → Example
❌ Don't cross-reference patterns (circular dependencies)
✅ Maximum two levels: Command → Pattern (self-contained)
✅ Patterns reference external docs (URLs) only

### 3. Loading Pattern Docs in Commands
❌ Don't use `@.claude/patterns/*.md` (loads into context)
❌ Don't load patterns during normal execution
✅ Reference patterns in comments: `# See .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
✅ Load only when implementing/debugging

### 4. Hardcoding Paths in Subagents
❌ Don't write `prps/research/` in subagent prompts
❌ Don't assume file locations
✅ Parameterize ALL paths from command
✅ Pass paths as context variables

### 5. Skipping Security Validation
❌ Don't assume feature names are safe
❌ Don't trust user input (INITIAL.md)
✅ Whitelist validation: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`
✅ Sandbox user content with clear delimiters

### 6. Breaking Parallel Execution
❌ Don't implement sequential loops for independent tasks
❌ Don't forget "ALL in SINGLE response" rule
✅ Invoke ALL tasks in same response (before any wait)
✅ Include timing validation (< 7 min for Phase 2)

---

- All patterns extracted to examples/

✅ **Validation strategy (9/10)**:
- 5-level validation (syntax, unit, integration, performance, token)
- Security test suite (10+ malicious inputs)
- Backwards compatibility testing
- Performance regression detection
- Comprehensive checklist

✅ **Error handling (10/10)**:
- Graceful Archon degradation
- Feature name validation (security)
- Prompt injection detection
- Backwards compatibility (old PRPs)
- Cleanup safety (archive-first)

**Deduction reasoning** (-1 point):
- Minor gap: No pattern versioning strategy (how to evolve patterns over time)
- Minor gap: No multi-user conflict handling (simultaneous PRP generation)
- These are edge cases unlikely to impact initial implementation

**Mitigations**:
- Pattern versioning: Add version comments to pattern docs, track changes in git
- Multi-user conflicts: File scoping prevents most conflicts, document in CLAUDE.md if needed

**Confidence Level**: HIGH
- All critical functionality preserved
- Security thoroughly addressed
- Performance optimizations maintained
- File organization solves pollution problem
- Pattern library enables reuse and maintenance

**Implementation Time Estimate**: 6-9 hours
- Phase 0: 2 hours (file paths, validation)
- Phases 1-3: 3-4 hours (pattern extraction)
- Phase 4: 1 hour (cleanup command)
- Phases 5-6: 2-3 hours (docs, testing)

**First-Pass Success Probability**: 85%
- Well-defined tasks with specific examples
- Security gotchas documented with tests
- Validation gates at each level
- Comprehensive backwards compatibility
