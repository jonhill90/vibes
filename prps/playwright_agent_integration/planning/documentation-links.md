## Primary Framework Documentation

### Playwright Python
**Official Docs**: https://playwright.dev/python/
**Version**: Latest (compatible with Python 3.8+)
**Archon Source**: Not in Archon
**Relevance**: 10/10 - Core technology for browser automation

**Sections to Read**:

1. **Getting Started - Library**: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library

   - **Key Concepts**:
     - `page.goto()` for navigation
     - `page.locator()` for element selection
     - `page.get_by_role()`, `page.get_by_text()`, `page.get_by_label()` for semantic queries
     - `page.wait_for_selector()` for explicit waits

3. **Locators Guide**: https://playwright.dev/docs/locators
   - **Why**: Resilient element selection is critical for agent validation
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Prioritize role-based locators (most accessible)
     - Text-based locators for non-interactive elements
     - Label-based locators for form fields
     - Avoid CSS/XPath selectors (brittle)
     - Locators are strict by default

4. **Accessibility Testing**: https://playwright.dev/docs/accessibility-testing
   - **Why**: Agents should use accessibility tree for validation, not screenshots
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Automated tests detect common issues only
     - Manual testing still required
     - Use Axe-core for automated scanning
     - Combine automated + manual + user testing

5. **API Testing Guide**: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api-testing
   - **Why**: Integration between API and browser testing
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - `APIRequestContext` for direct HTTP requests
     - Prepare server state via API before UI testing
     - Reuse authentication states
     - Hybrid testing approach (API + browser)

6. **Timeouts Configuration**: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts
   - **Why**: Error handling for slow operations
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Default test timeout: 30 seconds
     - Default assertion timeout: 5 seconds
     - Configure per-test or globally
     - Only increase when necessary (indicates design issues)

7. **Browser Installation**: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro
   - **Why**: First-time setup requirement
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - `pip install playwright` then `playwright install`
     - `playwright install --with-deps` for system dependencies
     - Browsers stored in OS-specific cache folders
     - Supports Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

8. **Accessibility API**: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-accessibility
   - **Why**: Understanding accessibility tree structure for validation
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - `snapshot()` method captures tree (deprecated but available)
     - Returns structured dict with role, name, value, focused, children
     - Use for validation without screenshots
     - Prefer modern accessibility libraries (Axe) for testing

**Code Examples from Docs**:

```python
# Example 1: Synchronous browser automation
# Source: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("http://localhost:5173")
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()
```

```python
# Example 2: Asynchronous browser automation
# Source: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch()
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("http://localhost:5173")
        print(await page.title())
        await browser.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

```python
# Example 3: Semantic element interaction
# Source: https://playwright.dev/docs/locators
page.get_by_role("button", name="Sign in").click()
page.get_by_label("Username").fill("user123")
page.get_by_text("Welcome, John").is_visible()
```

```python
# Example 4: Accessibility tree validation
# Source: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-accessibility
snapshot = page.accessibility.snapshot()

def find_focused_node(node):
    if node.get("focused"):
        return node
    for child in (node.get("children") or []):
        found_node = find_focused_node(child)
        if found_node:
            return found_node
    return None

focused = find_focused_node(snapshot)
```

```python
# Example 5: Hybrid API + Browser testing
# Source: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api-testing
# Prepare state via API
request_context = await playwright.request.new_context(base_url="http://localhost:5000")
await request_context.post("/api/documents", data={"title": "Test Doc"})

# Validate in browser
page = await browser.new_page()
await page.goto("http://localhost:5173/documents")
await expect(page.get_by_text("Test Doc")).to_be_visible()
```

**Gotchas from Documentation**:

- **Thread Safety**: Playwright is NOT thread-safe - create separate instances per thread
- **No time.sleep()**: Use Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms, not Python's sleep
- **Windows Async**: Requires `ProactorEventLoop` for async operations on Windows
- **Auto-wait**: Playwright auto-waits for elements, but timeout errors still possible
- **Locator Strictness**: Operations fail if multiple elements match - use `.first()`, `.last()`, `.nth()` explicitly
- **Deprecated Methods**: `snapshot()` for accessibility tree is deprecated - prefer Axe integration
- **Browser Binaries**: Must run `playwright install` after pip install to download browsers

## Integration Guides

### Hybrid API + Browser Testing
**Guide URL**: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api-testing
**Source Type**: Official Documentation
**Quality**: 10/10
**Archon Source**: Not in Archon

**What it covers**:
- Using APIRequestContext for direct HTTP calls
- Preparing server-side state before browser testing
- Validating browser actions against server state
- Reusing authentication between API and browser contexts

**Code examples**:

```python
# Hybrid testing pattern
# Source: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api-testing

# 1. Prepare state via API (fast)
request_context = await playwright.request.new_context(
    base_url="http://localhost:5000"
)
response = await request_context.post("/api/issues", data={
    "title": "New Issue",
    "body": "Issue description"
})
issue_id = response.json()["id"]

# 2. Validate in browser (user-facing)
page = await browser.new_page()
await page.goto(f"http://localhost:5173/issues/{issue_id}")
await expect(page.get_by_text("New Issue")).to_be_visible()

# 3. Validate server state via API (fast)
response = await request_context.get(f"/api/issues/{issue_id}")
assert response.json()["status"] == "open"
```

**Applicable patterns**:
- Use API testing for business logic validation (fast, reliable)
- Use browser testing for UI/UX validation (user-facing)
- Combine both for full-stack validation
- Prepare test data via API, validate UI via browser

### React Component E2E Testing with Playwright
**Resource**: https://sapegin.me/blog/react-testing-5-playwright/
**Type**: Tutorial / Best Practices
**Relevance**: 9/10

**Key Practices**:

1. **Use Semantic Queries**: Find elements by label text or ARIA role (matches user experience)
2. **Avoid Implementation Details**: Don't test internal component state or props
3. **Leverage Auto-Wait**: Playwright waits for elements automatically
4. **Test Isolation**: Each test gets fresh browser context (zero overhead)
5. **Development Server**: Run dev server before tests (can automate with config)
6. **Data Test IDs**: Add `data-testid` attributes for non-semantic elements
7. **Visual Regression**: Use Playwright's screenshot comparison for visual changes

**Code example**:

```python
# React component E2E test pattern
# Source: React testing best practices

def test_document_upload_flow(page):
    # Navigate to app
    page.goto("http://localhost:5173")

    # Use semantic queries (accessible to users)
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Upload Document").click()

    # Fill form with semantic labels
    page.get_by_label("Document Title").fill("Test Document")
    page.get_by_label("File").set_input_files("test.pdf")

    # Submit and wait for result
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Submit").click()

    # Validate success (visible to users)
    expect(page.get_by_text("Upload successful")).to_be_visible()

    # Validate in document list
    expect(page.get_by_role("listitem").filter(
        has_text="Test Document"
    )).to_be_visible()
```

### API vs Browser Testing Strategy
**Resource**: https://devot.team/blog/api-vs-ui-testing
**Type**: Best Practices Guide
**Relevance**: 10/10

**What it covers**:
- When to use API testing (business logic, speed, stability)
- When to use browser testing (UX, visual, cross-browser)
- Hybrid approach for comprehensive validation

**Decision Matrix**:

| Scenario | API Testing | Browser Testing |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Business logic validation | ✅ Preferred | ❌ Overkill |
| Data integrity checks | ✅ Preferred | ❌ Overkill |
| User interaction flows | ❌ Can't test | ✅ Required |
| Visual validation | ❌ Can't test | ✅ Required |
| Cross-browser compatibility | ❌ Not applicable | ✅ Required |
| Performance testing | ✅ Easier to scale | ❌ Slow |
| Early development (no UI) | ✅ Available | ❌ Blocked |
| Acceptance testing | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Complete |

**Key Insights**:
- **API testing is 10x faster** than browser testing
- **Browser testing catches UI/UX issues** API testing misses
- **Hybrid approach is optimal** for full-stack validation
- **Reserve browser tests for user-facing scenarios**
- **Use API tests for setup/teardown** (faster than browser clicks)

## Best Practices Documentation

### Browser Automation Error Patterns
**Resource**: https://autify.com/blog/playwright-timeout
**Type**: Tutorial / Troubleshooting Guide
**Relevance**: 9/10

**Key Practices**:

1. **Catch Timeout Errors**: Use try-catch with `TimeoutError` check
2. **Retry Pattern**: Implement retry logic for flaky operations
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Handle optional elements that may not appear
4. **Configure Timeouts**: Increase only when necessary (indicates design issues)
5. **Use Auto-Wait**: Prefer Playwright's built-in waiting over manual waits

**Example**:

```python
# Error handling pattern
# Source: https://autify.com/blog/playwright-timeout

from playwright.sync_api import TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError

def wait_for_element_with_retry(page, selector, max_attempts=3):
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            page.wait_for_selector(selector, timeout=5000)
            return True
        except PlaywrightTimeoutError:
            if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                return False
            time.sleep(1)
    return False

# Usage in validation
if wait_for_element_with_retry(page, ".success-message"):
    print("Element found")
else:
    print("Element not found after retries - continuing")
```

---

### Accessibility-First Testing
**Resource**: https://components.guide/accessibility-first/playwright
**Type**: Testing Methodology
**Relevance**: 10/10

**Key Principles**:

1. **Use ARIA Snapshots**: Structured representation of accessibility tree
2. **Role-Based Locators**: Match how assistive technology perceives elements
3. **Semantic Queries**: Find elements by accessible name, not CSS
4. **Validate Accessibility**: Use Axe-core for automated accessibility checks
5. **Manual Testing**: Automated tools catch ~30% of issues, manual testing required

**Example**:

```python
# Accessibility-first validation pattern
# Source: https://components.guide/accessibility-first/playwright

# 1. Use semantic locators (accessible to screen readers)
page.get_by_role("button", name="Submit")
page.get_by_label("Email Address")
page.get_by_text("Welcome back")

# 2. Validate ARIA structure
expect(page.locator('button[aria-label="Close"]')).to_be_visible()

# 3. Check keyboard navigation
page.keyboard.press("Tab")
expect(page.locator(':focus')).to_have_attribute('role', 'button')

# 4. Verify screen reader announcements (via aria-live)
page.get_by_role("button", name="Upload").click()
expect(page.locator('[aria-live="polite"]')).to_have_text("Upload complete")
```

### End-to-End Testing Best Practices (2025)
**Resource**: https://www.browserstack.com/guide/10-test-automation-best-practices
**Type**: Best Practices Compilation
**Relevance**: 8/10

**Key Practices**:

1. **Careful Planning**: Define scope, timelines, expected output with documentation
2. **Atomic Tests**: Create independent, autonomous tests for reliable results
3. **Prioritize High-Impact**: Focus on mission-critical user journeys
4. **Page Object Model**: Minimize code duplication, simplify updates
5. **Early Integration**: Integrate E2E testing early in development
6. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Keep test scripts up-to-date with UI changes
7. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify consistent behavior across browsers
8. **Self-Healing Tests**: AI-powered tests adapt to UI changes
9. **Proper Test Data**: Use realistic, diverse test data
10. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate test execution in deployment pipeline

**Application to Agent Validation**:
- Agents should create atomic validation tests (one concern per validation)
- Prioritize validating critical user flows first
- Use accessibility tree (semantic) rather than CSS selectors (brittle)
- Document validation results for ongoing maintenance
- Run browser validation only after API validation passes (faster feedback)

## Documentation Gaps

**Not found in Archon or Web**:
- **MCP_DOCKER specific tool documentation**: INITIAL.md references MCP_DOCKER tools, but no official docs found for this specific server
  - **Recommendation**: Infer from Playwright MCP patterns, test tools empirically during implementation

- **Agent-specific browser automation patterns**: No documentation for how Claude agents specifically should use browser tools
  - **Recommendation**: Create pattern based on general Playwright best practices + agent capabilities

**Outdated or Incomplete**:
- **Accessibility.snapshot() deprecated**: Playwright deprecated the `snapshot()` method but doesn't provide clear migration path for agents
  - **Suggested alternatives**: Use Axe-core integration or rely on semantic locators + assertions instead of tree inspection

- **MCP browser tool parameter details**: Execute Automation docs show tools but lack detailed parameter schemas
  - **Suggested alternatives**: Test tools during implementation, document findings in browser-validation.md pattern

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

When generating the PRP:

1. **Include these URLs** in "Documentation & References" section
   - Playwright Python library docs (primary)
   - MCP protocol specification
   - Playwright MCP server references
   - Accessibility testing guide

2. **Extract code examples** shown above into PRP context
   - Sync and async browser automation patterns
   - Semantic locator usage
   - Error handling with timeout retry
   - Hybrid API + browser testing
   - Accessibility tree validation

3. **Highlight gotchas** from documentation in "Known Gotchas" section
   - Thread safety issues
   - Browser installation requirement
   - Timeout configuration
   - Locator strictness
   - Deprecated accessibility snapshot method
   - MCP_DOCKER tool naming pattern

4. **Reference specific sections** in implementation tasks
   - "See Playwright Locators guide: https://playwright.dev/docs/locators for semantic query patterns"
   - "Reference MCP tool configuration from Archon knowledge base (12-factor-agents)"
   - "Follow timeout handling pattern from https://autify.com/blog/playwright-timeout"

5. **Note gaps** so implementation can compensate
   - MCP_DOCKER tools lack official docs - test empirically
   - Accessibility snapshot deprecated - use semantic locators instead
   - No agent-specific browser patterns - create new pattern from general best practices
