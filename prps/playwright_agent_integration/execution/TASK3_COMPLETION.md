## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Pattern Structure (Following quality-gates.md Format)

- **Overview Section**: What browser validation is, when to use it, key principles
- **Quick Reference**: Common browser tool commands with code snippets
- **Core Pattern**: Navigation → Interaction → Validation (3-step workflow)
- **Rules Section**: DO/DON'T lists (10 DOs, 10 DON'Ts)
- **Integration with Quality Gates**: Level 3b positioning with performance comparison
- **Examples Section**: 3 complete workflows (document upload, task creation, error handling)
- **Gotchas Section**: All 12 gotchas from gotchas.md with detection and solutions
- **Error Patterns**: 6 common errors with causes and fixes
- **Pre-Flight Checks**: 4 validation checks with complete implementation

#### 2. Code Examples (Copy-Paste Ready)

Extracted and adapted from all 6 examples:
- Example 1: Complete document upload workflow (70+ lines)
- Example 2: Task creation workflow (40+ lines)
- Example 3: Error handling with retries (60+ lines)
- All examples include pre-flight checks, error handling, validation logic
- All examples use semantic locators (no hard-coded refs)
- All examples use accessibility tree for validation (not screenshots)

#### 3. Gotchas Coverage (All 12 from gotchas.md)

1. Browser Binaries Not Installed - Detection, problem, solution, pre-flight check
2. Frontend Service Not Running - Detection, problem, solution with health checks
3. Thread Safety Violations - Detection, multiprocessing pattern
4. Element References Change - Detection, semantic query solution
5. Timeout Errors - Detection, retry pattern, timeout configuration
6. Agent Token Budget - Detection, snapshot vs screenshot comparison
7. Fixed Waits - Detection, auto-wait pattern
8. Browser Context Lifecycle - Detection, context manager pattern
9. Testing Implementation Details - Detection, user behavior pattern
10. MCP Tool Naming - Detection, YAML short name pattern
11. Port Conflicts - Detection, service identity verification
12. Sync/Async API Mixing - Detection, correct API selection

Each gotcha includes:
- Severity level
- Detection method
- Problem code (marked with ❌)
- Solution code (marked with ✅)

#### 4. Integration with Quality Gates

- Clear positioning as Level 3b (Integration Tests)
- Performance comparison table (Level 1-3b timing)
- Complete multi-level validation example with browser integration
- When to use each level guidance
- Browser tests as slowest but necessary for UI validation

#### 5. Error Patterns Documentation

6 common errors documented:
- Connection refused → Frontend not running → docker-compose fix
- Browser not found → Binaries missing → browser_install fix
- Element ref not found → Hard-coded refs → Semantic query fix
- Timeout exceeded → Operation slow → Increase timeout/retry fix
- Memory allocation → Context leak → Context manager fix
- Wrong service → Port conflict → Identity verification fix

#### 6. Pre-Flight Checks Pattern

Complete pre-flight check system:
- Check browser installed (with auto-install)
- Check frontend running (with auto-start)
- Check port available (conflict detection)
- Verify service identity (wrong service detection)
- Complete `run_preflight_checks()` function

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #6: Token Budget (from PRP gotchas.md)

**Implementation**: Clear guidance on accessibility snapshots (~500 tokens) vs screenshots (~2000 tokens)
```python
# ✅ RIGHT - Use accessibility snapshot for validation
snapshot = browser_snapshot()  # ~500 tokens, structured JSON
if "ExpectedElement" in snapshot:
    print("✅ Validation passed")

# ✅ ACCEPTABLE - One screenshot at end for human proof
browser_take_screenshot(filename="proof.png")
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents 4x token waste, enables agent validation

#### Gotcha #4: Element Refs (from PRP gotchas.md)

**Implementation**: Semantic query pattern throughout all examples
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Hard-coded refs change every render
browser_click(ref="e5")

# ✅ RIGHT - Semantic queries (stable)
browser_click(element="button containing 'Upload'")
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents flaky tests, ensures resilience to re-renders

#### Gotcha #2: Service Health (from PRP gotchas.md)

**Implementation**: Pre-flight checks before every test
```python
def ensure_frontend_running(port: int, service_name: str) -> bool:
    result = Bash(f"docker-compose ps {service_name}")
    if "Up" not in result.stdout:
        Bash("docker-compose up -d")
        time.sleep(10)
    return True
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents wasted validation attempts, clear error messages

#### Gotcha #7: Auto-Wait (from PRP gotchas.md)

**Implementation**: Clear DO/DON'T on manual sleep
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Manual sleep makes tests slow
time.sleep(3)

# ✅ RIGHT - Let Playwright auto-wait
page.goto("http://localhost:5173")  # Auto-waits for load
```

**Why Critical**: Faster tests, better reliability

#### Gotcha #9: Implementation Details (from PRP gotchas.md)

**Implementation**: User behavior pattern in examples
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Test CSS classes
assert page.locator(".modal-open").is_visible()

# ✅ RIGHT - Test user-visible behavior
expect(page.get_by_role("dialog")).to_be_visible()
```

**Why Critical**: Tests survive refactors, catch real bugs
