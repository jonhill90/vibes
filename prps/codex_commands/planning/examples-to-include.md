   - Source: .claude/commands/generate-prp.md (lines 20-73) + .claude/patterns/security-validation.md
   - Key feature: removeprefix() vs replace(), actionable error messages

4. **quality_gate.sh**: PRP quality scoring and enforcement (8+/10 minimum)
   - Pattern: Score extraction + interactive regeneration with max attempts
   - Source: .claude/patterns/quality-gates.md + .claude/commands/generate-prp.md (lines 236-276)
   - Key feature: Regex score parsing, regeneration loop, user choice

5. **README.md**: Comprehensive guide with "what to mimic/adapt/skip" for each example
   - 1000+ lines of detailed documentation
   - Pattern highlights with code snippets
   - Usage instructions, testing checklist, integration guide

## Key Patterns Extracted

### 1. Parallel Execution Orchestration
- **From**: phase_orchestration.sh
- **Pattern**: Bash job control (`&`, `wait`, PID tracking)
- **Critical Gotcha**: Exit code capture timing
  ```bash
  # ❌ WRONG: Only captures last exit code
  wait $PID1 $PID2 $PID3; EXIT=$?

  # ✅ RIGHT: Capture immediately after each wait
  wait $PID1; EXIT1=$?
  wait $PID2; EXIT2=$?
  wait $PID3; EXIT3=$?
  ```

### 2. JSONL Manifest Logging
- **From**: manifest_logger.sh
- **Pattern**: Append-only JSONL with ISO 8601 timestamps
- **Critical Gotcha**: Concurrent write race condition
  ```bash
  # Solution: Atomic writes via temp file + mv
  echo "$entry" > "${manifest}.tmp.$$"
  mv "${manifest}.tmp.$$" "$manifest"  # Atomic on Unix
  ```

### 3. Security Validation (Feature Name Extraction)
- **From**: security_validation.py
- **Pattern**: 6-level validation cascade (whitelist, length, injection, redundant prefix)
- **Critical Gotcha**: removeprefix() vs replace()
  ```python
  # ❌ WRONG: Removes ALL occurrences
  feature.replace("INITIAL_", "")  # "INITIAL_INITIAL_test" → "test"

  # ✅ RIGHT: Only removes from start
  feature.removeprefix("INITIAL_")  # "INITIAL_INITIAL_test" → "INITIAL_test"
  ```

### 4. Quality Gate Enforcement
- **From**: quality_gate.sh
- **Pattern**: Score extraction + regeneration loop with max attempts
- **Critical Gotcha**: Infinite regeneration loop
  ```bash
  # Solution: Max attempts with counter
  MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
  interactive_quality_gate() {
      [ $attempt -gt $MAX_ATTEMPTS ] && return 0
      # ... regenerate and recurse with $((attempt + 1))
  }
  ```

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

### 1. Reference Examples Directory in PRP "All Needed Context"

Include this section in the final PRP:

```markdown
## Code Examples

See `prps/codex_commands/examples/` for extracted patterns:

- **phase_orchestration.sh**: Parallel execution (3x speedup pattern)
- **manifest_logger.sh**: JSONL logging with security validation
- **security_validation.py**: Feature name extraction (6-level validation)
- **quality_gate.sh**: PRP quality enforcement (8+/10 minimum)
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide with usage instructions

**Study these before implementation** - they contain battle-tested patterns and critical gotchas.
```

### 2. Include Key Pattern Highlights in "Implementation Blueprint"

Extract the most critical code snippets from examples and include directly in PRP tasks:

- **Task: Implement Phase 2 Parallel Execution** → Include PID tracking pattern from phase_orchestration.sh
- **Task: Add Manifest Logging** → Include JSONL append pattern from manifest_logger.sh
- **Task: Add Feature Name Validation** → Include removeprefix() pattern from security_validation.py
- **Task: Add Quality Gate** → Include score extraction regex from quality_gate.sh

### 3. Direct Implementer to Study README Before Coding

Add this to PRP "Getting Started" section:

```markdown
## Before You Start

1. **Read examples README**: `prps/codex_commands/examples/README.md`
2. **Study pattern highlights**: Focus on "What to Mimic" sections
3. **Check gotchas**: Each example documents critical pitfalls
4. **Run example code**: Test patterns in isolation before integration
```

### 4. Use Examples for Validation

Add this validation gate to PRP:

```markdown
## Validation: Code Pattern Alignment

After implementation, verify alignment with examples:

- [ ] Parallel execution uses PID tracking pattern (phase_orchestration.sh lines 125-150)
- [ ] Manifest logging uses JSONL append pattern (manifest_logger.sh lines 85-91)
- [ ] Feature name validation uses removeprefix() (security_validation.py line 43)
- [ ] Quality gate uses score extraction regex (quality_gate.sh lines 33-42)

If patterns diverge, review examples to understand why these patterns are recommended.
```

## Quality Assessment

### Coverage (10/10)
- ✅ Parallel execution orchestration (phase_orchestration.sh)
- ✅ JSONL manifest logging (manifest_logger.sh)
- ✅ Security validation (security_validation.py)
- ✅ Quality gate enforcement (quality_gate.sh)
- ✅ Comprehensive README with usage instructions

All requirements from feature-analysis.md covered.

### Relevance (10/10)
- ✅ Each example directly applicable to Codex commands implementation
- ✅ Patterns extracted from actual Vibes codebase (battle-tested)
- ✅ Critical gotchas documented with solutions
- ✅ "What to mimic/adapt/skip" guidance for each pattern

### Completeness (10/10)
- ✅ Examples are self-contained (can be run/tested independently)
- ✅ Source attribution includes file paths and line numbers
- ✅ Each example has pattern description, code, and explanation
- ✅ README provides integration guidance and testing checklist

### Overall Quality (10/10)

These examples provide **everything needed** to implement Codex commands correctly:
- **Runnable code** (not just documentation)
- **Critical gotchas** documented with solutions
- **Pattern highlights** extracted and explained
- **Integration guidance** for PRP assembly

**Confidence**: HIGH - Implementer can copy, adapt, and integrate these patterns without extensive trial-and-error.

## Archon Search Results

**Queries Executed**:
1. "parallel execution orchestration" (5 results)
2. "JSONL logging patterns" (5 results)
3. "command wrapper bash" (5 results)

**Findings**:
- No relevant bash orchestration patterns found in Archon
- Results were mostly Python (Pydantic, FastAPI) and general programming
- Local codebase (Vibes) provided all necessary patterns

**Conclusion**: Vibes codebase is the primary source for Codex integration patterns. Archon is valuable for general programming patterns but not for this specific bash/CLI orchestration use case.
