## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. execute_parallel_group() Function
- **Input Parameters**:
  - `feature` - Feature name for logging
  - `group_name` - Logical group identifier (e.g., "phase2")
  - `phases` - Array of phase identifiers to execute in parallel
- **Functionality**:
  - Sources log-phase.sh for manifest logging
  - Creates log directory structure
  - Logs phase starts for all agents (separate manifests to avoid race condition)
  - Launches all agents in background with timeout wrapper
  - Captures PIDs immediately with `$!` (GOTCHA #7)
  - Waits for each agent and captures exit codes immediately (GOTCHA #1)
  - Interprets timeout exit codes (124, 125, 137) with special messaging (GOTCHA #8)
  - Logs phase completions with durations
  - Reports success/failure status for entire group

#### 2. Timeout Wrapper Integration
- Uses `timeout --kill-after=${KILL_AFTER_SEC}s ${DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SEC}s`
- Default timeout: 600 seconds (10 minutes per agent)
- Force kill after: 5 seconds if process doesn't respond to TERM signal
- Prevents zombie processes (GOTCHA #3)

#### 3. Separate Log Files per Agent
- Each agent redirected to: `prps/${feature}/codex/logs/${phase}.log`
- Prevents output interleaving from concurrent writes (GOTCHA #5)
- Enables debugging of individual agent failures

#### 4. Exit Code Capture and Validation
- **CRITICAL PATTERN**: `wait $PID; EXIT=$?` (immediate capture)
- Captures all exit codes in array for reporting
- Validates all succeeded (all exit codes = 0)
- Reports failures with specific exit codes and phase names
- Special handling for timeout exit codes:
  - 124 = Timeout occurred (exceeded time limit)
  - 125 = Timeout command failed (timeout not installed)
  - 137 = SIGKILL sent (process didn't respond to TERM)

#### 5. calculate_speedup() Helper
- Calculates sequential vs parallel execution time
- Reports speedup percentage
- Validates ≥2x speedup target achieved

#### 6. test_parallel_execution() Self-Tests
- Test 1: All agents succeed (3 agents x 2s = parallel execution confirmed)
- Test 2: One agent fails (exit code capture validation)
- Validates exit code capture works correctly
- Confirms parallel execution (duration ≤ max single agent time)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Exit Code Loss from Timing Race Condition
**Problem**: Bash only preserves exit code of most recent wait command. If you wait for multiple processes and then check `$?`, you only get the last one.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# CRITICAL: Capture exit code IMMEDIATELY after each wait
wait $PID_A; local exit_code=$?
# NOT: wait $PID_A; wait $PID_B; local exit_code=$?  # Only captures PID_B!
```

**Evidence**: Lines 117-125 in parallel-exec.sh - Each wait is followed immediately by exit code capture in loop

#### Gotcha #3: Zombie Processes from Missing Timeout Wrapper
**Problem**: Hung codex exec processes block workflow indefinitely with no error message or recovery mechanism.

**Implementation**:
```bash
timeout --kill-after=${KILL_AFTER_SEC}s ${DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SEC}s \
    codex exec --profile "$CODEX_PROFILE" --prompt "..." > log.txt 2>&1 &
```

**Evidence**: Lines 78-82 in parallel-exec.sh - All codex exec calls wrapped with timeout

#### Gotcha #5: Output Interleaving from Concurrent Writes
**Problem**: Multiple parallel processes writing to same stdout/stderr creates corrupted, unreadable logs.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Each agent gets separate log file
codex exec ... > "${log_dir}/${phase}.log" 2>&1 &
```

**Evidence**: Lines 75-82 in parallel-exec.sh - Each phase redirected to separate log file

#### Gotcha #7: Race Condition in Process Spawning
**Problem**: Fast-failing agent exits before PID is captured, leading to silent failure (agent fails but never gets waited on).

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Launch background process
codex exec ... &
# IMMEDIATELY capture PID
local pid=$!
pids+=("$pid")
```

**Evidence**: Lines 86-92 in parallel-exec.sh - PID captured immediately after background launch

#### Gotcha #4: Profile Omission in Codex Exec Calls
**Problem**: Using default profile instead of codex-prp profile leads to wrong model, wrong MCP servers, wrong approval policy.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# ALWAYS explicit profile
codex exec --profile "$CODEX_PROFILE" --prompt "..."
```

**Evidence**: Lines 79-81 in parallel-exec.sh - Explicit `--profile "$CODEX_PROFILE"` in all calls

#### Gotcha #8: Timeout Exit Code Confusion
**Problem**: Treating timeout (124) same as generic failure leads to wrong retry logic and misleading error messages.

**Implementation**:
```bash
case $exit_code in
    0)   status_msg="✅ SUCCESS" ;;
    124) status_msg="❌ TIMEOUT (exceeded ${DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SEC}s)" ;;
    125) status_msg="❌ TIMEOUT COMMAND FAILED (timeout not installed?)" ;;
    137) status_msg="❌ KILLED (SIGKILL - process didn't respond to TERM)" ;;
    *)   status_msg="❌ FAILED (exit ${exit_code})" ;;
esac
```

**Evidence**: Lines 128-147 in parallel-exec.sh - Case statement for exit code interpretation

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 1 (Security Validation)**: scripts/codex/security-validation.sh exists and loaded
- **Existing Infrastructure**: scripts/codex/log-phase.sh exists and used for manifest logging

### External Dependencies:
- **Bash 4.0+**: Required for associative arrays (used in arrays for PIDs, phases, exit codes)
- **GNU timeout**: Required for timeout wrapper (available on macOS via Homebrew coreutils)
- **codex CLI**: Required for actual agent execution (not tested here, but integration points prepared)
- **jq** (optional): Used in log-phase.sh for JSON parsing (fallback grep-based parsing available)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Codex Agents Available):

- [ ] Execute with 3 real Phase 2 agents (phase2a, phase2b, phase2c)
- [ ] Verify all agents launch simultaneously (timestamps within 5s)
- [ ] Verify separate log files created for each agent
- [ ] Verify manifest.jsonl has all phase entries
- [ ] Test timeout scenario (inject long-running agent)
- [ ] Test failure scenario (inject failing agent)
- [ ] Verify exit codes captured correctly for all scenarios

### Validation Results:

**Shellcheck Analysis**:
```
✅ Syntax check passed (bash -n)
⚠️  SC2155 warnings (declare and assign separately) - Minor, acceptable
ℹ️  SC1091 info (external file sourcing) - Expected for log-phase.sh
```

**Pattern Adherence**:
```
✅ Follows phase_orchestration.sh pattern (lines 112-161)
✅ PIDs captured immediately with $!
✅ Exit codes captured immediately after wait
✅ Timeout wrapper on all codex exec calls
✅ Separate log files per agent
✅ Explicit profile in all codex exec calls
```

**Function Availability**:
```
✅ execute_parallel_group() defined
✅ calculate_speedup() defined
✅ test_parallel_execution() defined
✅ show_usage() defined
```

**Exit Code Capture Test**:
```
✅ Mixed exit codes (0, 1, 0) captured correctly
✅ All success (0, 0, 0) captured correctly
✅ Parallel execution confirmed (3 agents in ~2s, not 6s sequential)
```
