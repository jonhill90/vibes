## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: PRP Parsing & Setup

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Feature name extraction from PRP file path with 6-level security validation
- ✅ PRP section parsing (Goal, Implementation Blueprint, Known Gotchas, Validation Loop)
- ✅ Task extraction from blueprint with dependency tracking
- ✅ Validation environment setup with state management

**Key Patterns Applied**:
- Security validation pattern from `security_validation.py` example
- Feature name extraction with path traversal prevention
- Regex-based section parsing with fallback handling

**Gotchas Addressed**:
- Path traversal in feature name (Level 1-2 validation)
- Dangerous characters in paths (Level 4 validation)
- Redundant prefix handling (Level 6 validation)

### Phase 2: Task Execution

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Sequential task execution following dependency order
- ✅ File tracking (created vs modified)
- ✅ Error recovery with retry/skip/abort options
- ✅ Implementation instructions for Codex agent

**Key Patterns Applied**:
- Task state tracking (completed, failed, skipped)
- File modification tracking for report generation
- Error handling with user choices

**Gotchas Addressed**:
- Reading existing files before modification (prevents overwriting)
- Tracking file creation vs modification separately
- Error context preservation for debugging

### Phase 3: Validation Loop

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Multi-level validation (Syntax → Tests → Coverage)
- ✅ Max 5 attempts with automatic retry
- ✅ Error analysis against PRP Known Gotchas
- ✅ Automatic fix application using gotcha solutions
- ✅ Blocker tracking for manual intervention

**Key Patterns Applied**:
- Quality gates pattern from `quality_gate.sh` example
- Error type classification (import, syntax, type, timeout)
- Gotcha search algorithm using regex matching
- Validation result tracking per level per attempt

**Gotchas Addressed**:
- Exit code capture from Bash commands
- Timeout handling for long-running validations
- Coverage extraction from pytest output
- Max attempts enforcement to prevent infinite loops

### Phase 4: Completion Report

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics (completion rate, coverage %, quality score)
- ✅ File modification summary (created vs modified)
- ✅ Validation results per level
- ✅ Blocker documentation with actionable details
- ✅ Next steps recommendations based on status

**Key Patterns Applied**:
- Markdown report generation with clear sections
- UTC timestamp for audit trail
- Percentage calculations with safety checks
- Conditional formatting based on success/failure

**Gotchas Addressed**:
- Coverage extraction handling missing data gracefully
- Division by zero protection (completion rate)
- Long error message truncation for readability

### Phase 5: Archon Integration

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Archon availability check with graceful degradation
- ✅ Project search by feature name
- ✅ Project status update with completion summary
- ✅ Follow-up task creation for blockers
- ✅ Error handling for Archon failures

**Key Patterns Applied**:
- Archon workflow pattern from `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
- Health check before operations
- Try/except for optional integration
- Project search before update

**Gotchas Addressed**:
- Archon unavailability doesn't block execution
- Project not found handled gracefully
- MCP server errors logged but don't fail workflow
