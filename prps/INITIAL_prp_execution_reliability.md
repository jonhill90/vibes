# INITIAL: PRP Execution Reliability & Documentation

**Author**: Human + Claude
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Category**: Internal Tooling - PRP System Enhancement
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: Medium

---

## Problem Statement

The `/execute-prp` workflow successfully implements code (100% completion on task_management_ui) but inconsistently generates documentation (48% report coverage). This creates audit gaps, makes post-execution analysis difficult, and prevents learning from implementation decisions.

### Current Issues

**Issue 1: No Mandatory Report Generation**
- Subagents can complete tasks without creating completion reports
- No validation gate checking report existence before continuing
- Result: 13 of 25 tasks in task_management_ui had no reports despite successful implementation

**Issue 2: Inconsistent Naming Conventions**
- Found 6 different report naming patterns in single PRP execution:
  - `TASK5_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`
  - `TASK_11_VALIDATION.md` (underscore position varies)
  - `TASK_18_COMPLETE.md` vs `TASK_17_COMPLETION.md`
  - `TASK22_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- No standardized template enforcing structure

**Issue 3: Path Configuration Bugs**
- Hardcoded paths without `{feature_name}` variable (FIXED 2025-10-06)
- Caused reports to save in wrong directories
- Example: `"Create prps/validation-report.md"` instead of `"Create prps/{feature_name}/execution/validation-report.md"`

**Issue 4: Missing Validation Loop**
- Execute-prp proceeds to next task/group even if reports missing
- No systematic verification that subagents completed documentation
- Silent failures in documentation generation

**Issue 5: Template Gaps**
- No standardized task completion report template
- No guidance for subagents on what to document
- Inconsistent quality and detail levels across reports

### Evidence from task_management_ui Execution

**Missing Reports by Group:**
- Group 1 (Foundation): 0/4 reports
- Group 2 (Backend/Frontend Core): 2/4 reports
- Group 3 (API Integration): 0/4 reports
- Group 4 (Main App): 3/3 reports ✅
- Group 5 (UI Components): 3/4 reports
- Group 6 (Docker/Testing): 4/5 reports
- Group 7 (Integration): 0/1 reports (but INTEGRATION_TEST_REPORT exists)

**Total: 12/25 reports (48%)**

All 25 tasks were implemented successfully (confirmed by integration tests), proving this is a documentation issue, not an implementation issue.

---

## Goal

Make PRP execution 100% reliable for both implementation AND documentation by enforcing mandatory reporting, standardizing formats, and adding validation gates.

### Success Criteria

**Execution Reliability:**
- [ ] 100% of tasks generate completion reports (verified programmatically)
- [ ] All reports follow standardized naming: `TASK{n}_COMPLETION.md`
- [ ] All reports use standardized template with required sections
- [ ] Validation gate blocks progression if report missing

**Documentation Quality:**
- [ ] Each task report includes: files modified, key decisions, challenges, validation status
- [ ] Test generation reports include: coverage %, test count, patterns used
- [ ] Validation reports include: all gates tested, pass/fail status, fix attempts
- [ ] Integration reports include: end-to-end test results, deployment verification

**Developer Experience:**
- [ ] Execute-prp provides clear progress indicators showing report generation
- [ ] Failures include actionable error messages pointing to missing reports
- [ ] Post-execution summary shows report coverage (X/Y tasks documented)
- [ ] Easy to audit what each subagent did via standardized reports

**Backward Compatibility:**
- [ ] Existing PRPs continue to work (don't break previous patterns)
- [ ] Optional: Regenerate missing reports for task_management_ui retrospectively

---

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Create Report Templates

**1.1 Task Completion Report Template**

Create `.claude/templates/task-completion-report.md`:

```markdown
# Task {task_number} Completion Report

**Task Name**: {task_name}
**Group**: {group_number}
**Status**: {COMPLETE|PARTIAL|FAILED}
**Duration**: {estimated_minutes} minutes
**Archon Task ID**: {archon_task_id} (if available)

---

### Phase 2: Update execute-prp.md Workflow

**2.1 Add Validation Gate After Each Task**

Update Phase 2 (Parallel Implementation):

```python
for group_number, group in enumerate(groups):
    if group['mode'] == "parallel":
        # Mark tasks as doing in Archon
        if archon_available:
            for task in group['tasks']:
                mcp__archon__manage_task("update",
                    task_id=get_archon_task_id(task, task_mappings),
                    status="doing")

        # Launch all implementers in parallel
        implementer_agents = []
        for task in group['tasks']:
            agent_id = Task(subagent_type="prp-exec-implementer",
                description=f"Implement {task['name']}",
                prompt=f'''
Implement single task from PRP.

PRP: {prp_path}
Task Number: {task['number']}
Task Name: {task['name']}
Responsibility: {task['responsibility']}
Files: {task['files']}
Pattern: {task['pattern']}
Steps: {task['steps']}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Implement all files listed in task
2. Create completion report: prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK{task['number']}_COMPLETION.md
3. Use template: .claude/templates/task-completion-report.md
4. Report MUST exist before you finish

Your task is INCOMPLETE without the completion report.
''')
            implementer_agents.append((task, agent_id))

        # NEW: Validate all reports were created
        for task, agent_id in implementer_agents:
            report_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK{task['number']}_COMPLETION.md"

            if not file_exists(report_path):
                error_msg = f"""
❌ Task {task['number']} Validation Failed

Task: {task['name']}
Expected Report: {report_path}
Status: REPORT MISSING

The subagent completed without creating a completion report.
This violates PRP execution standards.

Actions:
1. Check if subagent created report in wrong location
2. Re-run task with explicit report requirement
3. Create report manually if implementation is complete

Cannot proceed to Group {group_number + 1} until all reports exist.
"""
                raise ValidationError(error_msg)

            # Optional: Verify report has minimum required sections
            report_content = Read(report_path)
            required_sections = ["Implementation Summary", "Files Created/Modified", "Validation"]
            missing_sections = [s for s in required_sections if s not in report_content]

            if missing_sections:
                print(f"⚠️  Task {task['number']} report exists but missing sections: {missing_sections}")
                print(f"    Report may be incomplete but proceeding...")

        # Mark tasks as done in Archon
        if archon_available:
            for task in group['tasks']:
                mcp__archon__manage_task("update",
                    task_id=get_archon_task_id(task, task_mappings),
                    status="done")

        print(f"✅ Group {group_number} Complete: {len(group['tasks'])} tasks implemented, {len(group['tasks'])} reports generated")

    elif group['mode'] == "sequential":
        # Similar validation for sequential tasks...
```

**2.2 Update Validation Phase Prompt**

```python
Task(subagent_type="prp-exec-validator", description="Validate", prompt=f'''
Systematic validation with iteration loops (max 5 attempts per level).

PRP: {prp_path}
Feature: {feature_name}
Implemented: {implemented_files}
Tests: {test_files}

Pattern: .claude/patterns/quality-gates.md (multi-level, error analysis, fix application)

Steps:
1. Read PRP Validation Loop section
2. Execute validation levels (syntax, type, unit, integration, custom)
3. For failures: analyze → fix → retry (max 5 attempts per level)
4. Document all attempts and outcomes
5. Create prps/{feature_name}/execution/validation-report.md

CRITICAL: Use template .claude/templates/validation-report.md
Report MUST include all gates, pass/fail status, and fix attempts.

Your task is INCOMPLETE without the validation report.
''')

# Validate validation report exists
validation_report_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/validation-report.md"
if not file_exists(validation_report_path):
    raise ValidationError(f"Validator completed without creating {validation_report_path}")
```

**2.3 Update Test Generation Phase Prompt**

```python
Task(subagent_type="prp-exec-test-generator", description="Generate tests", prompt=f'''
Generate comprehensive tests (70%+ coverage).

PRP: {prp_path}
Feature: {feature_name}
Implemented: {get_all_modified_files()}

Steps:
1. Read all implemented files
2. Find test patterns in codebase
3. Generate unit tests (service/utility layers)
4. Generate integration tests (API/E2E)
5. Follow existing conventions
6. Ensure all tests pass
7. Create prps/{feature_name}/execution/test-generation-report.md

CRITICAL: Use template .claude/templates/test-generation-report.md
Report MUST include coverage %, test count, and patterns used.

Your task is INCOMPLETE without the test generation report.
''')

# Validate test report exists
test_report_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/test-generation-report.md"
if not file_exists(test_report_path):
    raise ValidationError(f"Test generator completed without creating {test_report_path}")
```

**2.4 Update Final Completion Summary**

```python
### Phase 5: Completion (YOU)

# Collect all reports
task_reports = glob(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK*_COMPLETION.md")
test_report = Read(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/test-generation-report.md")
validation_report = Read(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/validation-report.md")
execution_plan = Read(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/execution-plan.md")

# Calculate metrics
total_tasks = len(tasks)
reports_found = len(task_reports)
report_coverage = (reports_found / total_tasks) * 100

all_passed = check_all_validations_passed(validation_report)
coverage = extract_coverage(test_report)

# Report summary
print(f"""
{'✅ PRP Execution Complete!' if report_coverage == 100 else '⚠️  PRP Execution Partial'}

Feature: {feature_name}
Tasks: {total_tasks} (all implemented)
Reports: {reports_found}/{total_tasks} ({report_coverage:.0f}%)
Tests: {test_count} ({coverage}%)
Time: {elapsed_time} min
Speedup: {time_saved}%

Validation: {'✅ ALL GATES PASSED' if all_passed else '❌ SOME FAILURES'}

Documentation:
- Execution Plan: prps/{feature_name}/execution/execution-plan.md
- Task Reports: prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK*_COMPLETION.md ({reports_found} files)
- Test Report: prps/{feature_name}/execution/test-generation-report.md
- Validation Report: prps/{feature_name}/execution/validation-report.md

Next Steps:
1. Review validation report: cat prps/{feature_name}/execution/validation-report.md
2. Run tests: pytest tests/test_{feature}* -v
3. Review task reports for implementation details
4. Commit changes: git add . && git commit

Recommended actions:
1. Check for reports in wrong location: find . -name "TASK*_*.md"
2. Regenerate missing reports retrospectively
3. Update execute-prp.md validation gates (already improved)
""")
```

---

### Phase 3: Update Subagent Instructions

**3.1 Create/Update prp-exec-implementer Agent**

Since we don't have `.claude/subagents/`, this goes in the agent descriptions file or inline in execute-prp.md prompts (already updated above).

**Key requirements:**
- Must create `TASK{n}_COMPLETION.md` using template
- Must include all required sections
- Cannot finish until report exists
- Report saved in correct location: `prps/{feature_name}/execution/`

**3.2 Update prp-exec-validator Agent**

- Must create validation-report.md using template
- Must document all fix attempts
- Must include pass/fail status for each gate

**3.3 Update prp-exec-test-generator Agent**

- Must create test-generation-report.md using template
- Must calculate and report coverage
- Must list all generated test files

---

### Phase 4: Backward Compatibility & Migration

**4.1 Version Detection**

Add to execute-prp.md Phase 0:

```python
# Check for legacy PRP (pre-reliability update)
prp_version = detect_prp_version(prp_content)

if prp_version < "2.0":
    print(f"""
⚠️  Legacy PRP detected (version {prp_version})

This PRP may not have strict reporting requirements.
Execution will continue with best-effort documentation.

To update PRP: Add 'Version: 2.0' to PRP header
""")
    enforce_reports = False
else:
    enforce_reports = True
```

**4.2 Optional: Retrospective Report Generation**

For task_management_ui and other PRPs with missing reports:

```bash
# Create slash command /regenerate-prp-reports
cat > .claude/commands/regenerate-prp-reports.md <<'EOF'
# Regenerate PRP Reports

Analyzes implemented code from completed PRP and generates missing completion reports retrospectively.

**Usage**: /regenerate-prp-reports prps/{feature_name}

**Process**:
1. Read execution-plan.md to get task list
2. For each task without TASK{n}_COMPLETION.md:
   - Analyze implemented files for that task
   - Create retrospective completion report
   - Save as TASK{n}_RETROSPECTIVE.md (distinguishes from original execution)
3. Generate summary of regenerated reports

**Argument**: Feature name (e.g., "task_management_ui")
EOF
```

---

## Validation Gates

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] All templates designed and reviewed
- [ ] Execute-prp.md changes mapped out
- [ ] Validation gate logic defined

### During Implementation
- [ ] Each template created in correct location
- [ ] Execute-prp.md syntax valid (no Python errors in examples)
- [ ] All phases updated consistently
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Test PRP with 3 tasks generates 3 reports + 1 test report + 1 validation report
- [ ] Missing report blocks progression with clear error message
- [ ] All reports follow template structure
- [ ] Coverage calculation works correctly
- [ ] Existing PRPs still work (don't break)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execute simple test PRP: 100% report coverage
- [ ] Intentionally skip report in test: validation gate catches it
- [ ] Error message includes: task number, expected path, actionable steps
- [ ] Completion summary shows report coverage metric
- [ ] Templates are complete and usable

---

## Non-Goals

**Out of Scope:**
- Fixing existing PRPs retroactively (optional stretch goal)
- Changing PRP format or structure
- Modifying core subagent capabilities
- Adding new validation types (use existing gates)
- Real-time progress tracking UI
- Report versioning/history

**Explicitly Not Changing:**
- Parallel execution strategy
- Task dependency analysis
- Archon integration
- Quality gates implementation
- Test generation logic

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Breaking Existing PRPs**
- Mitigation: Add version detection, default to lenient mode for old PRPs
- Mitigation: Test with task_management_ui (already executed)

**Risk 2: Subagents Ignore Report Requirements**
- Mitigation: Make prompts extremely explicit: "INCOMPLETE without report"
- Mitigation: Validation gate catches missing reports immediately
- Mitigation: Error message includes exact path expected

**Risk 3: Performance Degradation**
- Mitigation: Validation gates are simple file existence checks (milliseconds)
- Mitigation: No additional subagent invocations (same execution flow)

**Risk 4: Template Overhead**
- Mitigation: Templates are markdown (easy to generate)
- Mitigation: Most sections can be auto-populated from context
- Mitigation: Optional sections for flexibility

**Risk 5: Report Clutter**
- Mitigation: All reports in single directory: `prps/{feature}/execution/`
- Mitigation: Clear naming convention: `TASK{n}_COMPLETION.md`
- Mitigation: .gitignore can exclude if desired (not recommended)

---

## Success Metrics

**Execution Reliability (Primary)**
- Report coverage: 48% → 100% for new PRPs
- Missing report detection: 0% → 100% (always caught)

**Documentation Quality (Secondary)**
- Reports follow template: 0% → 100%
- Reports include key decisions: Unknown → 100%
- Audit trail completeness: Partial → Complete

**Developer Experience (Tertiary)**
- Time to diagnose issues: Reduced (standardized reports)
- Post-execution analysis: Easier (all reports follow template)
- Learning from PRPs: Improved (consistent documentation)

---

## Future Enhancements

**Phase 2 (Future PRPs):**
- Report aggregation dashboard (single view of all task reports)
- Automated report quality scoring
- Report diff tool for comparing PRP executions
- Integration with Archon for task report linking

**Phase 3 (Future PRPs):**
- AI-powered report summarization
- Trend analysis across multiple PRP executions
- Report template customization per project type
- Real-time report generation preview
