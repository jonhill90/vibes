Since this is documentation, testing involves verifying accuracy:

- [x] Architecture diagram accurately reflects codebase structure
- [x] Quick Start commands work (`docker compose up`, health check)
- [x] Example 1 (simple command) curl command is syntactically correct
- [x] Example 2 (streaming) demonstrates line-by-line output
- [x] Example 3 (process management) shows list/kill actions
- [x] Example 4 (blocked command) shows rejection response
- [x] Example 5 (timeout) demonstrates timeout enforcement
- [x] Security allowlist matches `src/security.py` ALLOWED_COMMANDS
- [x] Security blocklist matches `src/security.py` BLOCKED_COMMANDS
- [x] Troubleshooting solutions are actionable
- [x] API reference matches tool implementations

1. **Architecture Diagram**: ASCII art showing complete data flow from client through all layers to subprocess execution, with resource limits annotated

2. **Copy-Paste Ready**: All 5 usage examples include full curl commands that can be copied and run immediately without modification

3. **Security Focus**: Extensive security section covering 7 different security layers, with best practices and recommendations

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**: 8 common issues with specific symptoms, root causes, and multiple solution approaches for each

5. **API Reference**: Complete parameter tables, return value documentation, and example requests/responses for both MCP tools

6. **Developer-Friendly**: Clear instructions for running tests, adding new commands, local development, and environment configuration

### Parallel Execution Safety

This task (Task 12) ran in parallel with Task 11 (integration tests). Safety was ensured by:
- **Only creating README.md** (no conflicts with test files)
- **No modification of existing files** (read-only access to implementation)
- **Independent resource** (documentation doesn't impact code execution)

### Documentation Philosophy

The README follows a "progressive disclosure" approach:
1. Quick overview for first-time users
2. Detailed architecture for understanding
3. Copy-paste examples for immediate use
4. Deep-dive sections for advanced users
5. Troubleshooting for problem-solving
6. API reference for integration

This structure serves multiple audiences:
- AI agents looking for quick API examples
- Developers integrating vibesbox into applications
- Security reviewers assessing safety measures
- Operations teams troubleshooting issues

**Task 12 COMPLETE** - Documentation provides comprehensive guide for using, developing, and troubleshooting the vibesbox MCP server.
