## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Blocked Commands List
```python
BLOCKED_COMMANDS = [
    "rm -rf /",
    "dd if=/dev/zero",
    ":(){ :|:& };:",  # Fork bomb
    "chmod -R 777 /",
    "mkfs",
    # Plus additional dangerous patterns
]
```
- Exact and substring matching for dangerous commands
- Prevents destructive operations (rm -rf /, disk wiping, fork bombs)
- Additional patterns beyond PRP requirements for enhanced security

#### 2. Allowed Commands Allowlist
```python
ALLOWED_COMMANDS = {
    # Read-only: ls, pwd, cat, grep, echo, find, head, tail, etc.
    # Write: touch, mkdir, cp, mv, ln
    # System: ps, top, df, du, whoami, hostname, etc.
    # Development: python, node, git, curl, wget, tar, zip
}
```
- Allowlist approach (more secure than blocklist only)
- 50+ common safe commands included
- Organized by category (read-only, write, system, development)

#### 3. Command Validation Function
```python
def validate_command(command: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Returns (is_valid, error_message)"""
```
- Uses `shlex.split()` for safe parsing (PRP Gotcha #2)
- Checks blocklist patterns
- Detects shell metacharacters (;, |, &, &&, ||, $, `)
- Validates base command against allowlist
- Returns detailed error messages for blocked commands

#### 4. Output Sanitization Function
```python
def sanitize_output(output: str) -> str:
    """Redacts secrets from command output"""
```
- Regex-based pattern matching for secrets
- Redacts: API keys, passwords, tokens, secrets
- Handles multiple formats (KEY=value, key: value, etc.)
- Cloud credentials (AWS), database URLs, private keys
- Returns output with `[REDACTED]` replacements

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Command Injection via shell=True
**From PRP**: "NEVER use shell=True with user input - enables command injection"
**Implementation**:
- Uses `shlex.split()` to safely parse commands
- Detects shell metacharacters that enable injection (;, |, &, $, `)
- Blocks command chaining attempts before execution

#### Gotcha #2: Allowlist vs Blocklist Security
**From PRP**: "Allowlists better than blocklists for command validation"
**Implementation**:
- Dual approach: Blocklist PLUS Allowlist
- Blocklist catches known dangerous patterns
- Allowlist ensures only vetted commands execute
- Base command extraction handles paths (/usr/bin/ls → ls)

#### Gotcha #3: Shell Metacharacter Detection
**From PRP**: "Shell metacharacters (;, |, &, &&, ||, $, `) are dangerous with shell=True"
**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive metacharacter set defined
- Checks for all dangerous patterns
- Special handling for > and < (comparison vs redirection)
- Clear error messages indicate which metacharacter was detected

#### Gotcha #4: Secrets Redaction
**From PRP Requirements**: "Redact secrets (API_KEY=, PASSWORD=, TOKEN=)"
**Implementation**:
- 15+ regex patterns for secret detection
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multiple formats (KEY=value, key:value, key="value")
- PEM private key detection and redaction
- Comprehensive coverage of common secret patterns

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- None - This is Task 3 in parallel execution group
- Runs independently of Task 2 (models.py) and Task 7 (Dockerfile)
- No file conflicts with parallel tasks (each modifies different files)

### External Dependencies:
- **Python standard library only**:
  - `re` - Regular expression matching for secret detection
  - `shlex` - Safe shell command parsing
  - `typing` - Type hints (Tuple)
- **No third-party packages required**

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Completed):
- [x] Allowed commands pass validation
  - `ls -la` → Valid ✓
  - `echo hello world` → Valid ✓
- [x] Blocked commands rejected with clear error
  - `rm -rf /` → Blocked (matches dangerous pattern) ✓
  - `dd if=/dev/zero` → Blocked ✓
  - `:(){ :|:& };:` → Blocked (fork bomb) ✓
- [x] Shell metacharacters caught
  - `ls; rm -rf /` → Blocked (semicolon detected) ✓
  - `ls | grep test` → Blocked (pipe detected) ✓
  - `cat file && rm file` → Blocked (&& detected) ✓
- [x] Secrets redacted from output
  - `API_KEY=sk-secret123` → `API_KEY=[REDACTED]` ✓
  - `PASSWORD=mysecret TOKEN=abc123` → Both redacted ✓

### Validation Results:
```
✓ Blocklist validation working correctly
✓ Allowlist validation working correctly
✓ Shell metacharacter detection functional
✓ Secret redaction patterns effective
✓ shlex.split() parsing handles edge cases
✓ Error messages clear and actionable
```

## Completion Report

**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review
**Implementation Time**: ~25 minutes
**Confidence Level**: HIGH

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Pattern Study** (5 min):
   - Reviewed PRP Task 3 specifications
   - Studied security gotchas from PRP documentation
   - Identified key requirements: blocklist, allowlist, metacharacters, secrets

2. **Implementation** (15 min):
   - Created BLOCKED_COMMANDS list with PRP patterns + extras
   - Created ALLOWED_COMMANDS set with 50+ safe commands
   - Implemented validate_command() with shlex parsing
   - Implemented sanitize_output() with 15+ regex patterns
   - Added comprehensive docstrings with examples

3. **Validation** (5 min):
   - Tested allowed commands (ls, echo) → Pass
   - Tested blocked commands (rm -rf /, dd) → Blocked correctly
   - Tested shell metacharacters (;, |, &) → Detected correctly
   - Tested secrets redaction → [REDACTED] working

### Files Created: 1
### Files Modified: 0
### Total Lines of Code: ~274 lines

### Key Decisions Made:

1. **Dual Security Approach**: Implemented BOTH blocklist AND allowlist
   - Blocklist catches known dangerous patterns
   - Allowlist ensures only vetted commands can run
   - More secure than either approach alone

2. **Extensive Allowlist**: Included 50+ commands beyond PRP minimum
   - Read-only commands: ls, cat, grep, find, etc.
   - Development tools: python, node, git, curl
   - Enables practical usage while maintaining security

3. **Comprehensive Secret Patterns**: 15+ regex patterns for redaction
   - API keys (multiple formats)
   - Passwords and tokens
   - Cloud credentials (AWS)
   - Database URLs
   - PEM private keys

4. **Base Command Extraction**: Handles command paths correctly
   - `/usr/bin/ls` → extracted as `ls` for allowlist check
   - Prevents bypassing allowlist with absolute paths

### Challenges Encountered:
None - Implementation was straightforward following PRP patterns

### Blockers:
None

### Next Steps:
- Task 4: Command Executor will use `validate_command()` before execution
- Task 4: Command Executor will use `sanitize_output()` on results
- Integration testing in Task 10 will verify end-to-end security

### Parallel Execution Safety:
✓ No file conflicts with Task 2 (models.py) or Task 7 (Dockerfile)
✓ Only created security.py (unique to this task)
✓ No shared resource modifications
✓ Safe for parallel execution

**Ready for integration with command executor and next implementation steps.**
