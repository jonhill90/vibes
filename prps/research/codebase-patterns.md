# Codebase Patterns: prp_context_cleanup

## Overview

This analysis extracts concrete implementation patterns from the existing PRP system codebase to guide the context cleanup refactoring. The current system uses multi-phase orchestration with Archon MCP integration, parallel subagent execution, and file-based research artifacts. Key patterns include: health-check-first Archon workflow, parallel Task invocation for speedup, scoped directory organization, error handling with graceful degradation, and quality gate validation.

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Phase-Based Workflow Orchestration

**Source**: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 10-582), `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (lines 9-620)
**Relevance**: 10/10 - Core pattern for both commands

**What it does**: Orchestrates complex workflows through distinct phases, each with clear inputs/outputs and responsibility boundaries. Commands act as lightweight coordinators, delegating work to specialized subagents.

**Key Techniques**:
```python
# Phase 0: Setup & Initialization (Command handles this)
# 1. Read input file
# 2. Extract feature name
# 3. Create directories
# 4. Check Archon health
# 5. Create Archon project + tasks

# Phase 1: Analysis (Single subagent)
# - Sequential execution
# - Creates foundation for Phase 2

# Phase 2: Parallel Research/Implementation (CRITICAL)
# - THREE subagents simultaneously
# - 3x speedup via parallelization
# - Independent work on separate artifacts

# Phase 3: Secondary Processing (Single subagent)
# - Gotcha detection OR test generation

# Phase 4: Assembly/Validation (Single subagent)
# - Synthesizes all prior work
# - Quality gates and scoring

# Phase 5: Completion & Reporting (Command handles this)
# - Validation checks
# - User-facing reports
# - Archon finalization
```

**When to use**:
- Multi-step workflows with clear dependencies
- Parallelizable research or implementation tasks
- Need for quality gates between phases
- Complex coordination requiring different expertise per phase

**How to adapt**:
- Keep Phase 0 and Phase 5 in command file (orchestration)
- Extract phase pseudocode to pattern documents
- Reference pattern docs instead of duplicating code
- Maintain parallel execution in Phase 2

**Why this pattern**:
- Clear separation of concerns (command vs subagent)
- Enables parallel execution where possible
- Testable phase boundaries
- Progressive disclosure (load phase details on-demand)

### Pattern 2: Archon MCP Integration Workflow

**Source**: `examples/prp_workflow_improvements/archon_integration_pattern.md`, `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 38-77), `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (lines 39-71)
**Relevance**: 10/10 - Duplicated across 6+ locations, needs consolidation

**What it does**: Health-check-first pattern with graceful degradation when Archon unavailable. Creates projects and tasks for tracking, updates status throughout workflow, stores final documents.

**Key Techniques**:
```python
# 1. Health Check First (ALWAYS)
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

# 2. Graceful Fallback
if archon_available:
    # Create project
    project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create",
        title=f"PRP Generation: {feature_name}",
        description=f"Creating comprehensive PRP from {initial_md_path}"
    )
    project_id = project["project"]["id"]

    # Create tasks with priority ordering
    tasks = [
        {"title": "Phase 1: Analysis", "assignee": "subagent-name", "order": 100},
        {"title": "Phase 2A: Research", "assignee": "subagent-name", "order": 90},
        # Higher order = higher priority (0-100)
    ]

    task_ids = []
    for task_def in tasks:
        task = mcp__archon__manage_task("create",
            project_id=project_id,
            title=task_def["title"],
            description=f"{task_def['assignee']} - Autonomous execution",
            status="todo",
            assignee=task_def["assignee"],
            task_order=task_def["order"]
        )
        task_ids.append(task["task"]["id"])
else:
    project_id = None
    task_ids = []
    print("ℹ️ Archon MCP not available - proceeding without project tracking")

# 3. Task Status Updates Throughout Workflow
# Before starting phase
if archon_available:
    mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[0], status="doing")

# After completing phase
if archon_available:
    mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[0], status="done")

# 4. Parallel Task Updates (Phase 2)
if archon_available:
    # Update all parallel tasks to "doing"
    for i in [1, 2, 3]:  # Tasks 2A, 2B, 2C
        mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[i], status="doing")

    # After all complete
    for i in [1, 2, 3]:
        mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[i], status="done")

# 5. Error Handling - Reset on Failure
try:
    # Invoke subagent
    Task(subagent_type="agent-name", description="task", prompt=context)
except Exception as e:
    if archon_available:
        mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id,
            description=f"ERROR: {e}",
            status="todo"  # Reset to allow retry
        )

# 6. Project Completion
mcp__archon__manage_project("update",
    project_id=project_id,
    description=f"COMPLETED: {summary_stats}"
)

# 7. Document Storage
mcp__archon__manage_document("create",
    project_id=project_id,
    title=f"{feature_name}.md",
    content=final_content,
    document_type="prp"
)
```

**When to use**:
- Any multi-phase workflow requiring tracking
- Features needing project/task visibility
- Integration with Archon knowledge base
- Progress monitoring and status updates

**How to adapt**:
- Extract this entire pattern to `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
- Commands reference the pattern doc instead of duplicating
- Keep only health check and if/else branching in commands
- Load full pattern doc only when implementing Archon integration

**Why this pattern**:
- Graceful degradation (works without Archon)
- Task status flow: todo → doing → done → (or back to todo on error)
- Higher task_order = higher priority (0-100)
- Project tracking for multi-phase workflows
- Error recovery through status resets

**CRITICAL**: This pattern is currently duplicated across 6+ files. Consolidating to single source of truth is PRIMARY goal of this refactoring.

### Pattern 3: Parallel Subagent Execution

**Source**: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 128-234, 560-580), `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (lines 123-234, 585-597)
**Relevance**: 10/10 - Key innovation, must preserve

**What it does**: Invokes multiple Task tools in SINGLE response to execute independent subagents simultaneously, achieving 3x speedup for research and 30-50% speedup for implementation.

**Key Techniques**:
```python
# CRITICAL: Parallel Phase 2 Research (generate-prp)
# Sequential would be: 5min + 4min + 5min = 14 minutes
# Parallel: max(5, 4, 5) = 5 minutes (64% faster)

# 1. Prepare context for EACH subagent
researcher_context = f'''Research task context...'''
hunter_context = f'''Documentation task context...'''
curator_context = f'''Example extraction task context...'''

# 2. Update ALL Archon tasks to "doing" BEFORE invoking
if archon_available:
    for i in [1, 2, 3]:  # Tasks 2A, 2B, 2C
        mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[i], status="doing")

# 3. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Invoke ALL THREE in SINGLE response
# Print user-facing message
print("Invoking all three Phase 2 research subagents in parallel...")

# Then invoke all three Task tools in THIS SAME RESPONSE:
Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-codebase-researcher",
     description="Search codebase patterns",
     prompt=researcher_context)

Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-documentation-hunter",
     description="Find official documentation",
     prompt=hunter_context)

Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-example-curator",
     description="Extract code examples",
     prompt=curator_context)

# 4. After ALL complete, update Archon tasks to "done"
if archon_available:
    for i in [1, 2, 3]:
        mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_ids[i], status="done")

# CRITICAL: execute-prp Parallel Implementation
# Group-based parallelization for task dependencies

for group_number, group in enumerate(groups):
    if group['mode'] == "parallel":
        # Update ALL group tasks to "doing"
        if archon_available:
            for task in group['tasks']:
                archon_task_id = get_archon_task_id(task, task_mappings)
                mcp__archon__manage_task("update",
                    task_id=archon_task_id, status="doing")

        # Prepare contexts for ALL tasks in group
        implementer_contexts = []
        for task in group['tasks']:
            ctx = f'''Implement {task['name']}...'''
            implementer_contexts.append((task, ctx))

        # ⚠️ CRITICAL: Invoke ALL in SINGLE response
        for task, ctx in implementer_contexts:
            Task(subagent_type="prp-exec-implementer",
                 description=f"Implement {task['name']}",
                 prompt=ctx)

        # Mark all done AFTER all finish
        if archon_available:
            for task in group['tasks']:
                archon_task_id = get_archon_task_id(task, task_mappings)
                mcp__archon__manage_task("update",
                    task_id=archon_task_id, status="done")

    elif group['mode'] == "sequential":
        # Execute one at a time (dependencies require it)
        for task in group['tasks']:
            # ... standard sequential pattern
```

**When to use**:
- Independent tasks with no file conflicts
- Research phases (Archon search, web search, code extraction)
- Implementation tasks in different files/modules
- Any work that can be done simultaneously

**How to adapt**:
- Extract parallelization logic to `.claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md`
- Include timing math and speedup calculations in pattern doc
- Commands reference pattern for "how to invoke parallel tasks"
- Keep only the actual Task() invocations in commands

**Why this pattern**:
- 3x speedup for research (generate-prp Phase 2)
- 30-50% speedup for implementation (execute-prp Phase 2)
- Separate context windows prevent conflicts
- Archon tracks all tasks independently
- System automatically waits for all to complete

**Performance Math**:
```
Generate-PRP Phase 2:
- Sequential: 5min + 4min + 5min = 14 minutes
- Parallel: max(5, 4, 5) = 5 minutes
- Speedup: 64% faster

Execute-PRP (6 tasks example):
- Sequential: 6 × 20min = 120 minutes
- Parallel (3 groups): 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 minutes
- Speedup: 50% faster
```

### Pattern 4: File Organization with Scoped Directories

**Source**: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 35-36), `prps/INITIAL_prp_context_cleanup.md` (lines 85-97, 289-292)
**Relevance**: 10/10 - THIS is what we're refactoring TO

**What it does**: Creates feature-scoped directories to prevent root directory pollution. All artifacts for a feature go in `prps/{feature}/` subdirectories.

**Current Pattern** (PROBLEM):
```bash
# Global pollution - multiple features share same directories
prps/research/                    # GLOBAL - all features dump here
  ├── feature-analysis.md         # Which feature?
  ├── codebase-patterns.md        # Which feature?
  └── documentation-links.md      # Which feature?

examples/{feature}/               # ROOT POLLUTION
  ├── example_1.py
  └── README.md
```

**Desired Pattern** (SOLUTION):
```bash
# Scoped per-feature - clean separation
prps/{feature_name}/
├── INITIAL.md                    # User's original request
├── {feature_name}.md             # Final PRP deliverable
├── planning/                     # Phase 1-3 research artifacts
│   ├── feature-analysis.md
│   ├── codebase-patterns.md
│   ├── documentation-links.md
│   ├── examples-to-include.md
│   └── gotchas.md
├── examples/                     # Phase 2C extracted code
│   ├── README.md
│   └── *.py files
└── execution/                    # Phase 0-5 execution artifacts
    ├── execution-plan.md
    ├── test-generation-report.md
    └── validation-report.md
```

**Key Techniques**:
```bash
# Feature name extraction (consistent pattern)
# From file: prps/INITIAL_user_auth.md → "user_auth"
# From file: prps/user_auth.md → "user_auth"
feature_name = extract_feature_name(file_path)

# Directory creation (generate-prp Phase 0)
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/planning")
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/examples")

# Directory creation (execute-prp Phase 0)
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/execution")

# Subagent output paths (ALL updated for scoped directories)
# Phase 1 output
output_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/feature-analysis.md"

# Phase 2A output
output_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/codebase-patterns.md"

# Phase 2B output
output_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/documentation-links.md"

# Phase 2C outputs
output_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/examples-to-include.md"
examples_dir = f"prps/{feature_name}/examples/"

# Phase 3 output
output_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/gotchas.md"

# Phase 4 output (execute-prp)
output_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/execution-plan.md"
```

**When to use**:
- ANY PRP generation or execution workflow
- Features generating multiple artifacts
- Long-lived projects with cleanup needs
- Avoiding root directory pollution

**How to adapt**:
- Update ALL path references in commands
- Update ALL path references in subagent prompts
- Provide backward compatibility (check both old and new paths)
- Document migration path for users

**Why this pattern**:
- Zero root directory pollution
- Self-contained feature artifacts
- Easy cleanup via directory removal
- Clear scope boundaries
- Scalable to infinite features

**Migration Strategy**:
```python
# Backward compatibility for existing PRPs
def get_artifact_path(feature_name, artifact_type):
    """Try new path first, fall back to old path."""
    new_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/planning/{artifact_type}.md"
    old_path = f"prps/research/{artifact_type}.md"

    if file_exists(new_path):
        return new_path
    elif file_exists(old_path):
        return old_path
    else:
        return new_path  # Create new path
```

---

### Pattern 5: Subagent Invocation with Context Passing

**Source**: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 89-122), `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (lines 83-117)
**Relevance**: 10/10 - Core invocation pattern

**What it does**: Prepares comprehensive context strings for subagents, then invokes Task tool with subagent_type, description, and prompt parameters.

**Key Techniques**:
```python
# 1. Prepare comprehensive context string
context = f'''You are [role description] for PRP [generation/execution].

**Input File**: {input_path}
**Feature Name**: {feature_name}
**Archon Project ID**: {project_id if archon_available else "Not available"}

**Your Task**:
1. [Specific step 1]
2. [Specific step 2]
3. [Specific step 3]
...

**Critical Instructions**:
- [Important constraint or pattern to follow]
- [What to avoid]

**Output**: {expected_output_path}
'''

# 2. Invoke Task tool
Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-feature-analyzer",
     description="Brief description for UI",
     prompt=context)

# 3. Wait for completion (automatic)
# Claude Code waits for subagent to finish

# 4. Read output
result = Read(expected_output_path)
```

**Subagent Types** (Naming Convention):
```
# PRP Generation Subagents
prp-gen-feature-analyzer
prp-gen-codebase-researcher
prp-gen-documentation-hunter
prp-gen-example-curator
prp-gen-gotcha-detective
prp-gen-assembler

# PRP Execution Subagents
prp-exec-task-analyzer
prp-exec-implementer
prp-exec-test-generator
prp-exec-validator
```

**When to use**:
- Delegating specialized work to subagents
- Parallel or sequential task execution
- Need for separate context windows
- Autonomous subagent workflows

**How to adapt**:
- Keep context preparation in commands (it's contextual)
- Extract reusable context templates to pattern docs
- Keep Task() invocations in commands (they're the action)
- Reference subagent capabilities from pattern docs

**Why this pattern**:
- Clear role assignment
- Separate context windows prevent interference
- Archon project ID enables tracking
- Output path consistency
- Autonomous execution without user interaction

---

### Pattern 6: Quality Gates and Validation

**Source**: `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 363-395, 499-524), `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (lines 344-356, 526-550)
**Relevance**: 9/10 - Critical for deliverable quality

**What it does**: Validates outputs against quality criteria before delivery. For PRPs, requires 8+/10 score. For execution, requires all validation gates to pass.

**Key Techniques**:
```python
# Generate-PRP Quality Gates
quality_checks = [
    "PRP score >= 8/10",
    "All 5 research documents created",
    "Examples extracted to examples/{feature}/ (not just references)",
    "Examples have README with 'what to mimic' guidance",
    "Documentation includes URLs with specific sections",
    "Gotchas documented with solutions (not just warnings)",
    "Task list is logical and ordered",
    "Validation gates are executable commands",
    "Codebase patterns referenced appropriately"
]

# Read PRP and extract score
prp_content = Read(f"prps/{feature_name}.md")
quality_score = extract_score(prp_content)  # Look for "Score: X/10"

# Enforce minimum quality
if quality_score < 8:
    print(f"⚠️ Quality Gate Failed: PRP scored {quality_score}/10 (minimum: 8/10)")
    print("\nWould you like me to:")
    print("1. Regenerate with additional research")
    print("2. Review and improve specific sections")
    print("3. Proceed anyway (not recommended)")
    # Wait for user decision
else:
    # Proceed to delivery
    print(f"✅ Quality Gate Passed: {quality_score}/10")

# Execute-PRP Quality Gates
quality_checks = [
    "All PRP tasks implemented",
    "All files created/modified as specified",
    "Tests generated for all components",
    "Test coverage >= 70%",
    "All syntax checks pass",
    "All unit tests pass",
    "All integration tests pass",
    "All validation gates from PRP pass",
    "Known gotchas from PRP addressed"
]

# Verify each check
issues = []
for check in quality_checks:
    if not verify_check(check):
        issues.append(check)

# Report issues
if issues:
    print("⚠️ Quality Gate Issues:")
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"  - {issue}")
```

**When to use**:
- Before delivering any artifact
- After test generation
- Post-validation iteration
- Quality assurance checkpoints

**How to adapt**:
- Extract quality criteria to `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md`
- Reference prp_base.md checklist (already exists)
- Commands perform checks, pattern doc defines criteria
- Keep scoring logic in commands (it's workflow-specific)

**Why this pattern**:
- Prevents low-quality deliverables
- 8+/10 ensures implementation readiness
- Interactive user decision on failures
- Progressive quality improvement

```

**Justification**:
- **Per-feature scoping**: Eliminates root directory pollution
- **planning/ subdirectory**: All research artifacts in one place, easy to archive
- **examples/ subdirectory**: Code examples scoped to feature, not global
- **execution/ subdirectory**: Implementation artifacts separate from research
- **patterns/ directory**: Reusable implementation patterns (DRY principle)
- **Backward compatibility**: Old PRPs continue working with legacy `examples/{feature}/`

## Common Utilities to Leverage

### 1. Archon Health Check
**Location**: MCP tool `mcp__archon__health_check()`
**Purpose**: Verify Archon MCP server availability before operations
**Usage Example**:
```python
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

if archon_available:
    # Proceed with Archon operations
else:
    # Graceful fallback
```

### 2. Archon Project Management
**Location**: MCP tool `mcp__archon__manage_project()`
**Purpose**: Create, update, delete projects for tracking
**Usage Example**:
```python
project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create",
    title=f"PRP Generation: {feature_name}",
    description=f"Creating comprehensive PRP from {initial_md_path}"
)
project_id = project["project"]["id"]
```

### 3. Archon Task Management
**Location**: MCP tool `mcp__archon__manage_task()`
**Purpose**: Create, update task status throughout workflow
**Usage Example**:
```python
task = mcp__archon__manage_task("create",
    project_id=project_id,
    title="Phase 1: Feature Analysis",
    status="todo",
    assignee="prp-gen-feature-analyzer",
    task_order=100  # Higher = higher priority
)
task_id = task["task"]["id"]

# Update status
mcp__archon__manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="doing")
```

### 4. Archon Knowledge Base Search
**Location**: MCP tools `mcp__archon__rag_search_knowledge_base()`, `mcp__archon__rag_search_code_examples()`
**Purpose**: Search Archon for documentation and code patterns
**Usage Example**:
```python
# Search knowledge base (2-5 keywords only!)
docs = mcp__archon__rag_search_knowledge_base(
    query="FastAPI async",
    match_count=5
)

# Search code examples
examples = mcp__archon__rag_search_code_examples(
    query="validation decorator",
    match_count=3
)
```

### 5. Feature Name Extraction
**Location**: Inline logic in commands (should be extracted to utility)
**Purpose**: Consistent feature name extraction from file paths
**Usage Example**:
```python
# From: prps/INITIAL_user_auth.md → "user_auth"
# From: prps/user_auth.md → "user_auth"
feature_name = extract_feature_name(file_path, content)
```

**Recommendation**: Extract this to a shared utility pattern doc.

## Testing Patterns

### Integration Test Structure
**Pattern**: End-to-end PRP generation and execution workflows
**Example**: Generate PRP, execute PRP, verify all artifacts created
**Key techniques**:
- Quality score validation (8+/10 for PRPs)
- File existence checks
- Validation gate execution
- Test coverage verification (70%+ for execute-prp)

### Validation Gates (execute-prp)
**Pattern**: Multi-level validation with iteration loops
```bash
# Level 1: Syntax & Style
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Level 2: Unit Tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Level 3: Integration Tests
# (Project-specific commands from PRP)
```

**Subagent**: `prp-exec-validator` runs gates, iterates on failures until pass (max 5 attempts per level)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Duplicating Archon Workflow Across Files
**What it is**: Same health check, project creation, task management code in 6+ locations
**Why to avoid**: Maintenance nightmare, inconsistency, token waste
**Found in**:
- `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (lines 38-77)
- `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (lines 39-71)
- `examples/prp_workflow_improvements/archon_integration_pattern.md`
- Various subagent prompts
**Better approach**: Consolidate to `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`, reference from commands

### 2. Global Directory Pollution
**What it is**: All features dump research to `prps/research/`, examples to `examples/{feature}/` (root)
**Why to avoid**: Difficult cleanup, unclear scope, doesn't scale
**Found in**: Current system (pre-refactoring)
**Better approach**: Per-feature scoped directories `prps/{feature}/planning/`, `prps/{feature}/examples/`

### 3. Pseudocode in Command Files (80% of lines)
**What it is**: Detailed implementation logic, error handling, parallel execution math in command files
**Why to avoid**: Token waste, context bloat, violates progressive disclosure
**Found in**:
- `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` (582 lines, should be 80-120)
- `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` (620 lines, should be 80-120)
**Better approach**: Extract to `.claude/patterns/*.md`, reference from commands

### 4. Just References to Code (Not Extraction)
**What it is**: Saying "See src/api/auth.py" instead of extracting actual code
**Why to avoid**: PRP implementer has to hunt for examples, increases cognitive load
**Found in**: Some early PRPs before example-curator was enhanced
**Better approach**: Use `prp-gen-example-curator` to PHYSICALLY EXTRACT code to `examples/` with source attribution

### 5. Using TodoWrite for Task Tracking
**What it is**: Using TodoWrite instead of Archon task management
**Why to avoid**: Violates ARCHON-FIRST RULE in CLAUDE.md
**Found in**: OLD execute-prp pattern (before Archon integration)
**Better approach**: Always use Archon MCP if available, graceful fallback if not

### 6. Sequential Execution of Independent Tasks
**What it is**: Running Phase 2 research sequentially: 5min + 4min + 5min = 14 minutes
**Why to avoid**: Wastes time, no dependency between tasks
**Found in**: Old generate-prp before parallel enhancement
**Better approach**: Parallel invocation via multiple Task() calls in SINGLE response (5 minutes)

## Recommendations for PRP

Based on pattern analysis:

1. **Follow Phase-Based Workflow Orchestration** for command structure
   - Keep Phase 0 and Phase 5 in commands (setup and reporting)
   - Extract Phase 1-4 pseudocode to pattern docs
   - Reference pattern docs instead of duplicating logic

2. **Consolidate Archon Workflow to Single Pattern Doc**
   - Extract to `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
   - Include health check, project/task management, error handling
   - Commands reference this pattern instead of duplicating

3. **Preserve Parallel Execution Pattern**
   - Extract timing math and invocation details to `.claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md`
   - Keep actual Task() invocations in commands (they're the action)
   - Document 3x speedup for research, 30-50% for implementation

4. **Migrate to Per-Feature Scoped Directories**
   - Update ALL path references: `prps/{feature}/planning/`, `prps/{feature}/examples/`
   - Provide backward compatibility for old PRPs
   - Document migration in CLAUDE.md

5. **Extract Quality Gates to Pattern Doc**
   - Reference `prps/templates/prp_base.md` checklist (already exists)
   - Create `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md` for scoring criteria
   - Keep score enforcement in commands (workflow-specific)

6. **Create Cleanup Command**
   - New command: `.claude/commands/prp-cleanup.md`
   - Interactive: offer archive/delete/cancel options
   - Archive to `prps/archive/{feature}_{timestamp}/`

7. **Update Subagent Prompts for New Paths**
   - All 6 PRP generation subagents
   - All 4 PRP execution subagents
   - Only output path changes, core logic unchanged

## Next Steps for Assembler

When generating the PRP:

1. **Reference these patterns in "Current Codebase Tree" section**:
   - Phase-based workflow orchestration
   - Archon MCP integration (currently duplicated)
   - Parallel subagent execution
   - File organization (current vs desired)

2. **Include key code snippets in "Implementation Blueprint"**:
   - Health check pattern
   - Parallel Task invocation
   - Directory creation for scoped paths
   - Feature name extraction logic

3. **Add anti-patterns to "Known Gotchas" section**:
   - Don't duplicate Archon workflow across files
   - Don't use global directories for feature artifacts
   - Don't put 80% pseudocode in commands
   - Don't use TodoWrite (violates ARCHON-FIRST RULE)

4. **Use file organization for "Desired Codebase Tree"**:
   - Show new `.claude/patterns/` directory
   - Show per-feature scoped `prps/{feature}/` structure
   - Show consolidated commands (80-120 lines)

5. **Task breakdown should follow refactoring phases**:
   - Phase 0: File organization (foundation)
   - Phase 1-2: Pattern extraction
   - Phase 3: Command refactoring
   - Phase 4: Documentation updates
   - Phase 5: Testing and validation
