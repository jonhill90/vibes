## Primary Framework Documentation

### Context Engineering Methodology (Original Philosophy)

**Official Docs**: https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro
**Archon Source**: `b8565aff9938938b` (GitHub: coleam00/context-engineering-intro)
**Relevance**: 10/10

**Sections to Read**:

1. **README.md - Philosophy and Quick Start**: https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro/blob/main/README.md
   - **Why**: Foundational philosophy for why context engineering is "10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding"
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Context Engineering = comprehensive information ecosystem for AI
     - PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) = PRD + Curated Codebase Intelligence + Agent Runbook
     - Validation gates ensure iteration until success
     - Examples are the most powerful tool

2. **Claude Code Full Guide**: https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro/tree/main/claude-code-full-guide
   - **Why**: Explains subagent architecture and specialized task delegation
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Subagents operate in separate context windows (no pollution)
     - Each subagent has specialized system prompts
     - Tool access can be limited per subagent
     - Progressive disclosure through subagent architecture

3. **CLAUDE.md Examples**: https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro/blob/main/CLAUDE.md
   - **Why**: Shows how to structure project-wide rules and conventions
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Global rules file defines project patterns
     - Code structure, testing requirements, style guidelines
     - References to examples and documentation

**Code Examples from Docs**:

```bash
# Original context engineering workflow
# 1. Clone template
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/Context-Engineering-Intro.git

# 2. Set up project rules (CLAUDE.md)
# Edit CLAUDE.md to add project-specific guidelines

# 3. Add examples (highly recommended)
# Place relevant code examples in examples/ folder

# 4. Create initial feature request (INITIAL.md)
# Edit INITIAL.md with feature requirements

# 5. Generate comprehensive PRP
/generate-prp INITIAL.md

# 6. Execute the PRP
/execute-prp PRPs/your-feature.md
```

**Gotchas from Documentation**:
- Original version lacked Archon integration (we're adding it)
- No file organization scoping in original (we're fixing with `prps/{feature}/` structure)
- No parallel execution in original (we have it, must preserve it)
- Commands in original were 40-69 lines (our target: 80-120 lines with more features)

### Claude Code - Official Documentation

**Official Docs**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/
**Version**: Current (2025)
**Archon Source**: `9a7d4217c64c9a0a` (Anthropic Documentation)
**Relevance**: 10/10

**Sections to Read**:

1. **Subagents Overview**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
   - **Why**: Core to our multi-agent PRP system architecture
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Subagents are specialized AI assistants with specific purposes
     - Each has own context window (prevents pollution)
     - Configured with specific tools and system prompts
     - Can use different models per subagent
   - **Critical Quote**: "Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation and keeping it focused on high-level objectives."

2. **Custom Slash Commands**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands
   - **Why**: Our commands (`/generate-prp`, `/execute-prp`) need proper structure
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Commands are Markdown files in `.claude/commands/`
     - Frontmatter controls behavior (allowed-tools, description, model)
     - `$ARGUMENTS` captures command parameters
     - `description` field required for SlashCommand tool
   - **Command Structure**:
     ```markdown
     ---
     allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Read, Write
     argument-hint: [feature-name]
     description: Generate comprehensive PRP from INITIAL.md
     model: inherit
     ---

     # Command body with instructions
     ```

3. **Common Workflows**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows
   - **Why**: Shows best practices for command design and task delegation
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Use Plan Mode for safe code analysis
     - Create project-specific subagents in `.claude/agents/`
     - Use descriptive `description` fields for automatic delegation
     - Limit tool access to what each subagent needs

4. **Settings and Configuration**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings
   - **Why**: Understanding configuration hierarchy for pattern documents
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Enterprise > User > Project precedence
     - Memory files (CLAUDE.md) vs. Settings files (JSON)
     - `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` affects context (default: 15000)
     - Configuration inheritance and merging

**Code Examples from Docs**:

```yaml
# Frontmatter fields for slash commands
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Read, Write
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request with security focus
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
disable-model-invocation: false
---
```

```markdown
# File references in commands
# Reference a specific file
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

```bash
# Bash command execution in commands
Current git status: !`git status`
Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
```

**Gotchas from Documentation**:
- `SlashCommand` tool only works with commands that have `description` field populated
- Custom commands with frontmatter have character budget limit (15000 by default)
- Model selection: `inherit` uses main conversation model, aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) use specific models
- Over-complex commands can hit context limits - progressive disclosure essential

## Context Engineering Best Practices

### Anthropic Engineering Blog - Effective Context Engineering

**Official Docs**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents
**Relevance**: 9/10

**Sections to Read**:

1. **Core Principles - Context as Finite Resource**
   - **Why**: Fundamental to understanding why we're reducing command file sizes
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Treat context as "precious, finite resource"
     - Find "smallest possible set of high-signal tokens"
     - Goes beyond prompts to "curating what information enters model's attention budget"
   - **Critical Quote**: "Context engineering is about what configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior"

2. **System Prompts - Minimal Information Philosophy**
   - **Why**: Guides how to structure our reduced command files
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Use clear, direct language
     - Balance between overly complex and vague
     - Organize into distinct sections (background, instructions)
     - Aim for "minimal set of information that fully outlines expected behavior"

3. **Progressive Disclosure Strategies**
   - **Why**: Core pattern for our refactoring approach
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Just-in-Time Context: maintain lightweight identifiers, load dynamically
     - Enable "progressive disclosure where agents incrementally discover context"
     - Sub-Agent Architectures: use specialized agents with clean context windows
   - **Implementation**: "Agents maintain lightweight identifiers (file paths, stored queries, web links) and use these references to dynamically load data into context at runtime using tools"

4. **Tool Design Philosophy**
   - **Why**: How to design pattern documents that are loadable as tools/references
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Tools should be "self-contained, robust to error, extremely clear"
     - Minimize tool set complexity
     - Ensure "minimal overlap in functionality"

**Best Practices Summary**:
- Start with minimal prompts and iterate
- Provide diverse, canonical examples
- Allow agents autonomous exploration
- "Do the simplest thing that works"

**Gotchas**:
- Over-abstraction can reduce effectiveness - balance simplicity and completeness
- Context management is iterative - requires continuous refinement
- Progressive disclosure requires clear "information scent" for discovery

## Progressive Disclosure Patterns

### Nielsen Norman Group - Progressive Disclosure

**Official Docs**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/
**Type**: UX Research & Best Practices
**Relevance**: 8/10

**Key Principles**:

1. **Core Definition**
   - **What**: "Reveal information strategically - initially show only the most important options"
   - **Why**: Improves learnability, increases efficiency, reduces error rates
   - **Benefit**: Helps both novice and advanced users

2. **Feature Selection Strategy**
   - **Prioritize**: Frequently used features in initial display
   - **Method**: Use task analysis and usage statistics
   - **Ensure**: Primary display contains essential options

3. **Navigation Design**
   - **Make progression obvious**: Clear path to secondary features
   - **Use descriptive labels**: For advanced option buttons
   - **Provide information scent**: Enable feature discovery

4. **Complexity Management Rules**
   - **Limit levels**: Maximum 2 levels of disclosure
   - **Group logically**: Advanced features by category
   - **Avoid overwhelming**: Too many options at once

**Application to PRP Commands**:

```markdown
# Level 1: Command file (80-120 lines)
- WHAT: High-level orchestration
- WHO: Phase definitions
- WHEN: Execution order
- REFERENCES: Point to pattern docs

# Level 2: Pattern documents (loaded on-demand)
- HOW: Implementation details
- EXAMPLES: Concrete code patterns
- GOTCHAS: Edge cases and solutions
```

**Gotchas**:
- **Two-level maximum**: Don't create 3+ levels of nested references
- **Clear expectations**: Users must know hidden features exist
- **Staged vs. Progressive**: Staged = linear sequence (wizards), Progressive = optional features
- **Balance**: Between simplicity and comprehensive functionality

## Migration & Refactoring Strategies

### Software Refactoring Best Practices

**Sources**:
- Migration Strategies (Microsoft Azure): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/select-cloud-migration-strategy
- Refactoring Patterns (vFunction): https://vfunction.com/resources/guide-migration-strategies-basics-lift-and-shift-refactor-or-replace/
**Relevance**: 7/10

**Migration Strategies**:

1. **Refactor Approach** (Our chosen strategy)
   - **Definition**: Improves internal structure without adding new features
   - **When to use**: Reducing technical debt, modernizing code structure
   - **Benefit**: Long-term maintainability
   - **Complexity**: More complex than lift-and-shift, requires careful testing

2. **Backwards Compatibility Techniques**
   - **Path checking logic**: Support both old and new file structures
   - **Gradual migration**: Phase 0 first, then incremental refactoring
   - **Dual-mode operation**: Detect and handle both structures
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     # Support both old and new paths
     if os.path.exists(f"prps/{feature}/planning/feature-analysis.md"):
         # New structure
         path = f"prps/{feature}/planning/"
     elif os.path.exists("prps/research/feature-analysis.md"):
         # Old structure (backwards compatibility)
         path = "prps/research/"
     ```

3. **Rollback Planning**
   - Keep old command versions in `.claude/commands/archive/`
   - Document differences in migration guide
   - Provide script to revert file paths if needed

**Best Practices**:
- **Refactor is not for large migrations**: Recommended to rehost/replatform first, then modernize
- **Test carefully**: Avoid regressions in functionality
- **Compatibility issues**: Watch for library/dependency conflicts
- **Version-specific considerations**: Document what works with which versions

**Gotchas**:
- **Breaking changes risk**: Subagent interface changes can cascade
- **Path hardcoding**: Easy to miss hardcoded paths in subagent prompts
- **Test coverage**: Must test both old and new structures
- **Performance regression**: File I/O from loading pattern docs could negate savings

## DRY Principle & Code Extraction

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

**Sources**:
- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself
- HackerNoon: https://hackernoon.com/refactoring-013-eliminating-repeated-code-with-dry-principles
- GeeksforGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/dont-repeat-yourselfdry-in-software-development/
**Relevance**: 9/10

**Core Principle**:
- **Definition**: "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"
- **Formulated by**: Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in "The Pragmatic Programmer"
- **Goal**: Reduce repetition of information likely to change, replace with abstractions less likely to change

**Practical Techniques**:

1. **Create Functions or Methods**
   - Identify repeated logic
   - Encapsulate in reusable functions
   - Call from multiple locations

2. **Use Classes and Inheritance**
   - For complex scenarios
   - Create reusable components
   - Share common functionality

3. **Extract Constants**
   - Centralize repeated constants/configurations
   - Single source of truth
   - Avoid redundancy

4. **Step-by-Step Refactoring Process**:
   ```
   Step 1: Identify behavior duplication
   Step 2: Extract into reusable functions/classes
   Step 3: Reduce redundancy
   Step 4: Create single source of truth
   Step 5: Simplify future updates
   ```

**The "Rule of Three"**:
- **First occurrence**: Write inline
- **Second occurrence**: Note the duplication
- **Third occurrence**: Extract and refactor
- **Reasoning**: With 3+ examples, can precisely define patterns and abstractions

**Benefits**:
- Reduces likelihood of errors from inconsistent updates
- Centralized logic = easier maintenance
- Changes made in single location propagate everywhere

**Application to PRP System**:

```markdown
# BEFORE (Duplicated across 6+ locations):
# In generate-prp.md
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
if archon_available:
    project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create", ...)

# In execute-prp.md
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
if archon_available:
    project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create", ...)

# In each of 6+ subagent prompts
# [Same pattern repeated]

# AFTER (Single source of truth):
# In .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md
See documentation for Archon health check, project creation, task management patterns

# In commands:
For Archon integration patterns, see .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md
```

**Gotchas**:
- **Premature abstraction**: Can create overly complex code
- **Over-abstraction**: Sometimes controlled duplication is clearer
- **Rule of Three**: Don't abstract after just 1-2 occurrences
- **Context dependency**: Some "duplication" is actually different contexts requiring similar code

## Technical Writing & Documentation Standards

### Markdown Command Structure

**Sources**:
- Claude Code Best Practices: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices
- CloudArtisan Tutorial: https://cloudartisan.com/posts/2025-04-14-claude-code-tips-slash-commands/
- Apidog CLAUDE.md Guide: https://apidog.com/blog/claude-md/
**Relevance**: 8/10

**Command Structure Best Practices (2025)**:

1. **Organization & Readability**
   - Use standard Markdown headings (#, ##, ###)
   - Organize into logical sections
   - Distinct sections constrain agent behavior
   - Guide through deterministic process

2. **Dynamic Parameters**
   - `$ARGUMENTS`: Captures everything after command name
   - `$1`, `$2`, etc.: Individual arguments
   - Include instructions on how to format complex input
   - Provide `argument-hint` in frontmatter

3. **Version Control & Sharing**
   - Project-scoped: `.claude/commands/` (check into git)
   - User-scoped: `~/.claude/commands/` (personal)
   - Share commands with team via version control

4. **Iterative Development**
   - Treat CLAUDE.md as living document
   - Build iteratively during sessions
   - Press `#` to auto-incorporate instructions
   - Organic growth as you work

5. **Complementary Systems**
   - **CLAUDE.md**: Guidelines and context for many tasks
   - **Slash commands**: Specific, repeatable procedures
   - **Commands define workflows**, CLAUDE.md defines standards

**Example Command Structure**:

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [issue-number]
description: Find and fix GitHub issue
---

# Fix Issue #$ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

## 1. Understand the Issue
Read issue description and comments

## 2. Locate Relevant Code
Search codebase for affected areas

## 3. Implement Solution
Address root cause, not symptoms

## 4. Add Tests
Ensure fix is validated

## 5. Prepare PR Description
Concise summary of changes
```

**Best Practices Summary**:
- **Structure matters**: Headings create deterministic process
- **Be specific**: Include exact steps, not vague instructions
- **Use examples**: Show expected input/output formats
- **Complement CLAUDE.md**: Don't duplicate global rules
- **Share via git**: Project commands benefit entire team

## Documentation Gaps

**Not found in Archon or Web**:

1. **Context Engineering Metrics**
   - Gap: No quantitative measures for "good context engineering"
   - Needed: Token efficiency metrics, success rate measurements
   - Recommendation: Create our own metrics in PRP quality scoring

2. **Pattern Document Discovery Best Practices**
   - Gap: How to make pattern docs discoverable without always loading them
   - Needed: Indexing strategies, reference conventions
   - Recommendation: Create `.claude/patterns/README.md` index

3. **Subagent Failure Recovery Patterns**
   - Gap: Limited documentation on handling subagent failures
   - Needed: Retry logic, graceful degradation, error propagation
   - Recommendation: Document our error handling in `.claude/patterns/error-handling.md`

**Outdated or Incomplete**:

1. **Original Context Engineering Repo**
   - Issue: Doesn't include Archon integration (newer pattern)
   - Issue: No parallel execution (we've innovated beyond original)
   - Suggested Alternative: Use as philosophy foundation, supplement with our enhancements

2. **Claude Code Subagent Examples**
   - Issue: Documentation has basic examples, lacks complex multi-agent orchestration
   - Issue: No examples of parallel subagent invocation with shared state
   - Suggested Alternative: Create comprehensive examples in our codebase

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

When generating the PRP:

1. **Include these URLs** in "Documentation & References" section:
   - Context Engineering Intro (philosophy)
   - Claude Code Slash Commands (structure)
   - Effective Context Engineering (best practices)
   - Progressive Disclosure (UX pattern)
   - DRY Principle (refactoring strategy)

2. **Extract code examples** shown above into PRP context:
   - Frontmatter structure for slash commands
   - File reference syntax (`@file.js`)
   - Dynamic parameters (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`)
   - Backwards compatibility path checking
   - DRY refactoring patterns

3. **Highlight gotchas** from documentation in "Known Gotchas" section:
   - Two-level maximum for progressive disclosure
   - SlashCommand tool requires `description` field
   - Character budget limits (15000 default)
   - Rule of Three for DRY (don't abstract too early)
   - Context as finite resource (minimize per-command load)

4. **Reference specific sections** in implementation tasks:
   - Task 1: "See Progressive Disclosure principles: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/"
   - Task 2: "Follow DRY Rule of Three: https://hackernoon.com/refactoring-013-eliminating-repeated-code-with-dry-principles"
   - Task 3: "Apply Effective Context Engineering strategies: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents"

5. **Note gaps** so implementation can compensate:
   - Create our own pattern document discovery index
   - Document our error handling patterns (gap in official docs)
   - Establish our own context engineering metrics
