# Feature Analysis: PRP System Context Cleanup & Optimization

## INITIAL.md Summary

Refactor the PRP generation and execution system to eliminate context pollution by reducing command file sizes by 80% (582→120 lines for generate-prp, 620→100 lines for execute-prp), extracting implementation patterns to dedicated reference documents, consolidating Archon workflow to a single source of truth, and fixing file organization to use per-feature scoped directories instead of global pollution—all while preserving advanced functionality (Archon integration, parallel execution, quality scoring, validation loops).

## Core Requirements

### Explicit Requirements

1. **Reduce command file sizes by 80%**
   - generate-prp.md: 582 → 80-120 lines
   - execute-prp.md: 620 → 80-120 lines

2. **Extract implementation patterns to dedicated reference documents**
   - Archon workflow patterns
   - Parallel execution patterns
   - Quality gates and scoring
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Consolidate Archon workflow to single source of truth**
   - Currently duplicated across 6+ locations
   - Single authoritative reference document

4. **Fix file organization (per-feature scoped directories)**
   - Current problem: `prps/research/` (global pollution)
   - Current problem: `examples/{feature}/` (root directory pollution)
   - Desired: `prps/{feature}/planning/`, `prps/{feature}/examples/`, `prps/{feature}/execution/`

5. **Create cleanup command for archiving**
   - Archive or delete planning/, examples/, execution/ directories
   - Keep INITIAL.md and {feature}.md (core artifacts)
   - Interactive: offer user choice (archive/delete/cancel)

6. **Maintain or improve functionality and performance**
   - Archon MCP integration
   - Parallel subagent execution (3x speedup)
   - Quality scoring system (8+/10 minimum)
   - Physical code extraction
   - Validation iteration loops
   - Time tracking

### Implicit Requirements

1. **Backwards compatibility**
   - Existing PRPs must still execute without modification
   - Subagent interfaces preserved
   - User workflows unchanged (`/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` entry points)

2. **Progressive disclosure pattern**
   - Commands define WHAT, not HOW
   - Implementation details in referenced documents
   - Load pattern docs on-demand only

3. **Token efficiency**
   - 59% reduction per command invocation target
   - Pattern docs loaded separately when needed
   - Avoid duplicating context across files

4. **Documentation quality**
   - Migration path documented for users
   - Pattern documents with concrete examples
   - Clear separation of concerns

5. **Error handling preservation**
   - Archon graceful degradation when unavailable
   - Subagent failure recovery
   - Quality score failure handling

6. **Testing and validation**
   - Test new file organization before rollout
   - Regression test existing PRPs
   - Validate token reduction without functionality loss

### External Integrations

1. **Archon MCP Server**
   - Project management: `mcp__archon__manage_project`
   - Task tracking: `mcp__archon__manage_task`
   - Health checks: `mcp__archon__health_check`
   - Knowledge base search: `mcp__archon__rag_search_knowledge_base`
   - Code example search: `mcp__archon__rag_search_code_examples`
   - Document storage: `mcp__archon__manage_document`

2. **Claude Code Task System**
   - Task invocation for subagents
   - Parallel task execution capability
   - Separate context windows per subagent

3. **File System Operations**
   - Directory creation/deletion (Bash tool)
   - File reading/writing (Read/Write tools)
   - Pattern matching (Grep/Glob tools)

### Core Logic

**Phase-Based Workflow Pattern**:
- Phase 0: Setup & Initialization
- Phase 1: Analysis (feature analysis OR dependency analysis)
- Phase 2: Parallel Research/Implementation (3 subagents simultaneously)
- Phase 3: Gotcha Detection OR Test Generation
- Phase 4: Assembly OR Validation
- Phase 5: Completion Report

**Pattern Extraction Logic**:
1. Identify repeated code blocks across commands
2. Extract to dedicated pattern documents
3. Replace with references/imports
4. Validate functionality preserved

**File Organization Migration Logic**:
1. Update all path references in commands
2. Update all path references in subagent prompts
3. Create new directory structure on feature creation
4. Provide cleanup command for archival

**Archon Integration Pattern** (from existing code):
```python
# Health check first
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

# Graceful fallback
if archon_available:
    # Create project/tasks
    # Update status throughout workflow
else:
    # Continue without tracking
    print("ℹ️ Archon MCP not available - proceeding without project tracking")
```

### UI/CLI Requirements

**Command Interface** (unchanged):
- `/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_{feature}.md`
- `/execute-prp prps/{feature}.md`
- `/prp-cleanup {feature}` (NEW)

**User Interaction Points**:
1. **Cleanup command**: Interactive choice (archive/delete/cancel)
2. **Error handling**: Retry/continue/abort on failures
3. **Progress reporting**: Phase completion notifications
4. **Final report**: Success metrics, file locations, next steps

**Output Locations**:
- Planning artifacts: `prps/{feature}/planning/`
- Extracted examples: `prps/{feature}/examples/`
- Execution reports: `prps/{feature}/execution/`
- Archive: `prps/archive/{feature}/` (with timestamp)

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Core Technologies (Existing, Preserve)

- **Claude Code**: Command orchestration, subagent invocation
- **Archon MCP Server**: Project/task management, knowledge base
- **Markdown**: All documentation and PRP files
- **Python-style pseudocode**: Implementation guidance in patterns
- **Bash**: File system operations

### File Organization Tools

- **mkdir -p**: Directory creation
- **mv**: File archival
- **rm -rf**: Cleanup (with user confirmation)
- **wc -l**: Line count validation

### Pattern Extraction Approach

**DRY Principle Application**:
1. Identify repeated blocks (3+ occurrences = extract)
2. Create pattern document with:
   - Concrete code examples
   - Context/rationale
   - Common pitfalls
   - Reference usage
3. Replace repetition with reference
4. Validate no functionality lost

## Assumptions Made

### 1. **File Organization Migration**: Phased approach is acceptable

- **Assumption**: Can update file paths incrementally (Phase 0 first)
- **Reasoning**: Foundation must be solid before refactoring commands
- **Source**: INITIAL.md explicitly calls for Phase 0 first ("Why First: Establish clean structure before refactoring commands")
- **Risk**: Low - backwards compatible, old PRPs continue to work

### 2. **Pattern Documents**: Will be loaded on-demand, not always in context

- **Assumption**: Pattern docs referenced but not always loaded
- **Reasoning**: Token efficiency requires selective loading
- **Source**: Context Engineering principles (progressive disclosure)
- **Risk**: Medium - must ensure references are clear and discoverable

### 3. **Archon Integration**: Can consolidate to single pattern document

- **Assumption**: All Archon workflow variations can be unified
- **Reasoning**: Current duplications show same patterns with minor variations
- **Source**: Existing archon_integration_pattern.md shows unified approach
- **Risk**: Low - already proven pattern exists

### 4. **Command Size Reduction**: 80-120 lines is sufficient for orchestration

- **Assumption**: Commands can effectively orchestrate with minimal pseudocode
- **Reasoning**: Original Context Engineering commands were 40-69 lines
- **Source**: Archon knowledge base (context-engineering-intro)
- **Risk**: Low - proven approach, with more context (subagents) should be even easier

### 5. **Subagent Prompts**: Won't need major changes for new file paths

- **Assumption**: Subagent prompts just need output path updates
- **Reasoning**: Core logic unchanged, only destination directories change
- **Source**: Current subagent structure analysis
- **Risk**: Low - surgical changes only

### 6. **Backwards Compatibility**: Old structure PRPs will still execute

- **Assumption**: Can detect and handle both old and new file structures
- **Reasoning**: Phase 2 subagents can check both locations
- **Source**: Best practice for migrations
- **Risk**: Medium - requires careful path checking logic

### 7. **Cleanup Command**: Users want interactive choice, not automatic deletion

- **Assumption**: Archive by default, with delete option
- **Reasoning**: Generated artifacts may have value for reference
- **Source**: INITIAL.md specifies "INTERACTIVE: Offer user choice"
- **Risk**: Low - user controls destructive actions

### 8. **Quality Gates**: Can reference prp_base.md instead of duplicating

- **Assumption**: Validation checklist in template is sufficient
- **Reasoning**: Template already has comprehensive validation checklist
- **Source**: INITIAL.md line 119-122
- **Risk**: Low - DRY principle, single source of truth

### 9. **Token Reduction**: 59% savings achievable without functionality loss

- **Assumption**: Math is sound (1202 → 220 lines = 82% reduction)
- **Reasoning**: Pattern docs loaded separately, not always in context
- **Source**: INITIAL.md lines 331-342
- **Risk**: Medium - actual token counts depend on content density

### 10. **Example Extraction**: Will work with scoped directories

- **Assumption**: Scoped examples won't break code extraction logic
- **Reasoning**: Just a path change, extraction mechanism unchanged
- **Source**: Current example-curator agent analysis
- **Risk**: Low - path is parameterized

## Success Criteria

### File Organization
1. New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/planning/` (not global `prps/research/`)
2. New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/examples/` (not root `examples/{feature}/`)
3. New PRPs create `prps/{feature}/execution/` (scoped reports)
4. `/prp-cleanup` command works correctly (archive/delete options)
5. No root directory pollution from generated artifacts

### Command Simplification
1. generate-prp.md reduced to 80-120 lines (from 582)
2. execute-prp.md reduced to 80-120 lines (from 620)
3. All implementation patterns extracted to `.claude/patterns/`
4. Archon workflow consolidated to single source of truth
5. Report templates created and used by subagents

### Functionality Preservation
1. Test PRP generation completes successfully with new structure
2. Test PRP execution completes successfully with new structure
3. All functionality preserved (no regressions):
   - Archon integration (health check, project/task management)
   - Parallel Phase 2 research (3x speedup)
   - Parallel Phase 2 implementation (30-50% speedup)
   - Quality scoring (8+/10 minimum)
   - Physical code extraction to examples/
   - Validation iteration loops
   - Time tracking and metrics
4. Existing PRPs still executable without modification (backwards compatible)

### Efficiency & Documentation
1. Token usage reduced by ~50% per command invocation
2. Pattern documents discoverable and well-documented
3. Migration path documented for users
4. Cleanup workflow documented
5. CLAUDE.md updated with new pattern references

- `file_organization_example.sh` (directory structure creation)
- `cleanup_command_example.py` (archive/delete logic)
- `README.md` (example overview and usage)

### Gotcha Detective
**Focus Areas**:
1. **File path migration risks**:
   - Breaking existing PRPs with hardcoded paths
   - Missing path updates in subagent prompts
   - Path checking logic for backwards compatibility
2. **Pattern extraction pitfalls**:
   - Losing necessary context by over-abstracting
   - Pattern docs not being discoverable
   - Circular references or missing dependencies
3. **Archon integration issues**:
   - Breaking graceful degradation
   - Task status update failures
   - Health check timeouts
4. **Backwards compatibility breaks**:
   - Subagent interface changes
   - Command signature changes
   - Output structure changes
5. **Token efficiency paradox**:
   - Loading pattern docs negates savings
   - Context window bloat from references
   - Performance regression from file I/O
6. **Cleanup command dangers**:
   - Accidental deletion of important artifacts
   - Archive path collisions
   - Incomplete cleanup leaving orphaned files

**Output**: `prps/research/gotchas.md` with:
- 5-10 documented gotchas
- Each with problem description
- Each with solution/mitigation
- Each with validation test to prevent

## Validation Strategy

### Phase-Based Validation
1. **Phase 0 (File Organization)**: Test with sample feature
2. **Phase 1-2 (Pattern Extraction)**: Verify pattern docs have all necessary content
3. **Phase 3 (Command Refactoring)**: Test both commands with real PRPs
4. **Phase 4 (CLAUDE.md Update)**: Review for consistency
5. **Phase 5 (Final Validation)**: Regression test suite

### Test Cases
1. **New PRP Generation**: Verify new file structure created correctly
2. **New PRP Execution**: Verify execution artifacts in correct locations
3. **Old PRP Execution**: Verify backwards compatibility
4. **Cleanup Command**: Verify archive and delete operations
5. **Archon Unavailable**: Verify graceful degradation works
6. **Token Reduction**: Measure actual token usage vs target

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: 0 regressions
- **Token Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction
- **Command Size**: 80-120 lines (80%+ reduction)
- **File Organization**: 0 root directory pollution
- **Quality**: 8+/10 PRP score maintained
- **Performance**: Parallel execution timings maintained

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Pattern extraction losing context**: Mitigation = comprehensive examples in pattern docs
- **Backwards compatibility breaks**: Mitigation = path checking logic, gradual migration

### Medium Risk
- **Token savings not achieved**: Mitigation = measure early, adjust pattern granularity
- **Pattern docs not discoverable**: Mitigation = clear references in commands, CLAUDE.md index

### Low Risk
- **File organization migration**: Well-defined paths, tested before rollout
- **Cleanup command**: Interactive, user-controlled
- **Archon consolidation**: Already proven pattern exists

## Implementation Time Estimate

**Total**: 6-9 hours (per INITIAL.md)
- Phase 0 (File Organization): 2 hours
- Phase 1-2 (Pattern Extraction): 2-3 hours
- Phase 3 (Command Refactoring): 2-3 hours
- Phase 4 (CLAUDE.md Update): 0.5-1 hour
- Phase 5 (Testing): 1-2 hours

## Expected Benefits

1. **Token Efficiency**: 59% reduction per command invocation
2. **Maintainability**: 50% easier maintenance (centralized patterns)
3. **Clarity**: Separation of concerns (commands vs patterns vs templates)
4. **File Organization**: Zero root directory pollution from generated artifacts
5. **Cleanup**: Easy archival of completed features
6. **Scalability**: Self-contained feature directories scale infinitely
7. **Discoverability**: Pattern index in CLAUDE.md provides quick reference
8. **Quality**: No functionality regression, all tests pass

## Critical Dependencies

1. **Archon MCP Server**: Must maintain current API
2. **Claude Code Task System**: Must support parallel invocation
3. **Existing Subagents**: Interfaces must remain compatible
4. **File System**: Standard Unix tools (mkdir, mv, rm)

## Migration Path

### For Users
1. **Immediate**: New PRPs use new structure automatically
2. **Optional**: Use `/prp-cleanup {feature}` to reorganize old PRPs
3. **Future**: All PRPs gradually migrate to new structure

### For System
1. **Phase 0**: Update file paths (foundation)
2. **Phase 1-4**: Extract patterns, refactor commands
3. **Phase 5**: Test and validate
4. **Documentation**: Update all guides

### Rollback Plan
- Keep old command versions in `.claude/commands/archive/`
- Document differences in migration guide
- Provide script to revert file paths if needed
