# Feature Analysis: Initial Factory Removal

## INITIAL.md Summary

Remove the INITIAL.md Factory workflow system that was designed to automate the creation of INITIAL.md files through a 6-subagent process. The factory added unnecessary complexity by automating a creative thinking task that requires human judgment and only takes 10-20 minutes to complete manually. This cleanup will reduce the agent count by 50% (from 12+ to 6 agents) and remove ~200-300 lines of documentation from CLAUDE.md, returning to the cleaner workflow: Manual INITIAL.md → /generate-prp → /execute-prp.

## Core Requirements

### Explicit Requirements

1. **Delete 6 INITIAL factory subagent files** from `.claude/agents/`:
   - `prp-initial-feature-clarifier.md`
   - `prp-initial-codebase-researcher.md`
   - `prp-initial-documentation-hunter.md`
   - `prp-initial-example-curator.md`
   - `prp-initial-gotcha-detective.md`
   - `prp-initial-assembler.md`

2. **Delete the `/create-initial` command** file:
   - `.claude/commands/create-initial.md`

3. **Remove INITIAL.md Factory documentation** from `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Remove entire "INITIAL.md Factory Workflow" section (lines 185-378, ~193 lines)
   - Keep clean workflow documentation: Manual INITIAL.md → /generate-prp → /execute-prp

4. **Preserve all PRP generation and execution agents**:
   - Keep all `prp-gen-*` agents (6 agents)
   - Keep all `prp-exec-*` agents (4 agents)
   - Keep `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` commands
   - Keep INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md template

### Implicit Requirements

1. **Check for duplicate agent files**:
   - Some agents may exist in both `prp-gen-*` and `prp-initial-*` versions
   - Verify which agents have duplicates before deletion
   - Ensure no functionality is lost from the `prp-gen-*` versions

2. **Update documentation references**:
   - Remove all references to the factory workflow from CLAUDE.md
   - Update workflow diagrams/descriptions to show simplified flow
   - Ensure no broken links or references to deleted agents

3. **Verify no code dependencies**:
   - Check if any commands reference the prp-initial-* agents
   - Check if any other documentation references the factory workflow
   - Ensure clean deletion without breaking existing workflows

4. **Maintain documentation quality**:
   - Keep the workflow section coherent after removal
   - Preserve context about PRP-driven development methodology
   - Update agent count references from "12+" to "10" (6 prp-gen + 4 prp-exec)

## Technical Components

### Data Models

**Files to Delete**:
- 6 agent definition files (`.claude/agents/prp-initial-*.md`)
- 1 command file (`.claude/commands/create-initial.md`)
- ~193 lines from CLAUDE.md (lines 185-378)

**Files to Preserve**:
- All `prp-gen-*` agent files (6 files)
- All `prp-exec-*` agent files (4 files)
- `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` commands
- INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md template
- Core PRP methodology documentation

### External Integrations

None - this is a pure cleanup task with no external dependencies.

### Core Logic

**Deletion Process**:
1. Identify exact files to delete (6 agents + 1 command)
2. Identify exact line range in CLAUDE.md to remove
3. Verify no references exist in other files
4. Delete files
5. Update CLAUDE.md
6. Verify documentation coherence

**Verification Process**:
1. Check that `/generate-prp` command still references correct agents
2. Check that `/execute-prp` command still references correct agents
3. Verify CLAUDE.md renders properly without orphaned sections
4. Ensure workflow descriptions are accurate

### UI/CLI Requirements

No UI changes - this is a file deletion and documentation update task.

- **Key Patterns**:
  - Original workflow: Manual INITIAL.md → /generate-prp → /execute-prp
  - Focus on human thinking for creative tasks
  - Automation targets mechanical work (research/implementation)
- **Gotchas**:
  - Factory workflow added complexity that wasn't needed
  - Manual INITIAL.md creation is fast (10-20 minutes) and requires judgment
- **Application to this task**: This is exactly the workflow we're returning to - the factory was an over-automation

## Recommended Technology Stack

**Tools Required**:
- **File Operations**: Standard file deletion (rm, Write tool)
- **Text Editing**: Write tool for CLAUDE.md updates
- **Verification**: Grep, Glob for finding references
- **Testing**: Manual verification of commands and documentation

**No New Dependencies**: This is a pure cleanup task using existing tools.

## Assumptions Made

### 1. **Agent File Duplication**
- **Assumption**: Some agents may have both `prp-gen-*` and `prp-initial-*` versions
- **Reasoning**: The grep results show 6 prp-initial agents and 6 prp-gen agents with similar names (documentation-hunter, example-curator, gotcha-detective, assembler, codebase-researcher)
- **Source**: File system analysis (grep/glob results)
- **Action**: Verify duplicates exist and keep prp-gen-* versions

### 2. **CLAUDE.md Section Boundaries**
- **Assumption**: The INITIAL.md Factory section is complete from line 185-378
- **Reasoning**: Section starts with "## INITIAL.md Factory Workflow" (line 185) and ends with "---" separator before "## Development Patterns" (line 380)
- **Source**: Direct file reading
- **Action**: Remove lines 185-378, preserving the separator line 379

### 3. **No Code Dependencies on Factory Agents**
- **Assumption**: Only the `/create-initial` command references the prp-initial-* agents
- **Reasoning**: The factory was a self-contained workflow system
- **Source**: Architecture understanding from documentation
- **Action**: Verify with grep before deletion

### 4. **Example Files Can Be Preserved**
- **Assumption**: Files in `examples/prp_workflow_improvements/` that reference create-initial can be kept as historical reference
- **Reasoning**: They document the pattern evolution and don't break functionality
- **Source**: Best practice for documentation preservation
- **Action**: Leave example files intact but note they reference deprecated workflow

### 5. **Git Status Indicates Uncommitted Changes**
- **Assumption**: The 4 uncommitted modifications mentioned may be related to prp-gen vs prp-initial duplicates
- **Reasoning**: Recent work on agent infrastructure may have created or modified these files
- **Source**: INITIAL.md mention of git status
- **Action**: Review git status during implementation to understand current state

### 6. **Validation Through Command Execution**
- **Assumption**: Testing `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` commands is sufficient validation
- **Reasoning**: These are the core workflows that must continue working
- **Source**: PRP methodology best practices
- **Action**: After cleanup, verify both commands can be executed successfully

### CLAUDE.md Section Analysis

**Section to Remove**:
- Start line: 185 ("## INITIAL.md Factory Workflow")
- End line: 378 (last line of "Success Metrics" section)
- Total lines: 193 lines
- Section includes:
  - Overview
  - When to Use This Workflow
  - Immediate Recognition Actions
  - The 5-Phase Workflow (Phases 0-5)
  - Subagent Reference table
  - Archon Integration
  - Key Principles
  - Error Handling
  - Quality Gates
  - Success Metrics

**Line to Preserve**:
- Line 379: "---" (section separator)
- Line 380+: "## Development Patterns" (next section)

### Potential References to Check

Based on grep results, these files reference "create-initial":

1. `/Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/INITIAL_initial_factory_removal.md` - Current task file, expected
2. `/Users/jon/source/vibes/CLAUDE.md` - Will be cleaned up
3. `/Users/jon/source/vibes/examples/prp_workflow_improvements/README.md` - Historical documentation, can remain
4. `/Users/jon/source/vibes/examples/prp_workflow_improvements/archon_integration_pattern.md` - Historical documentation, can remain
5. `/Users/jon/source/vibes/examples/prp_workflow_improvements/factory_parallel_pattern.md` - Historical documentation, can remain

**Decision**: Leave example files intact as historical reference. They document pattern evolution and don't break functionality.

## Risk Analysis

### Low Risk Items

1. **Deleting agent files**: No dependencies found outside the factory workflow
2. **Deleting command file**: Only referenced in CLAUDE.md section being removed
3. **Updating CLAUDE.md**: Clear section boundaries, straightforward edit

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Agent file duplicates**: Need to verify prp-gen-* versions have all functionality
   - Mitigation: Compare file contents before deletion
   - Mitigation: Test /generate-prp workflow after cleanup

2. **Example file references**: Example files reference deprecated workflow
   - Mitigation: Leave examples as historical documentation
   - Mitigation: Add note in examples/ that factory workflow is deprecated

### High Risk Items

None identified. This is a straightforward cleanup task with clear boundaries.

## Implementation Complexity

**Estimated Effort**: Low
- File deletion: 5 minutes
- CLAUDE.md editing: 10 minutes
- Verification: 10 minutes
- Total: ~25 minutes

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Delete 6 agent files (simple file deletion)
2. Delete 1 command file (simple file deletion)
3. Edit CLAUDE.md to remove lines 185-378 (text editing)
4. Verify no broken references (grep verification)
5. Test /generate-prp and /execute-prp (manual testing)

## Next Steps for Downstream Agents

### Codebase Researcher
Focus on:
- Verifying no hidden references to prp-initial-* agents
- Checking for any imports or includes of deleted files
- Searching for indirect references (e.g., file path construction)
- Verifying example files don't have functional dependencies
- Checking git history for context on agent creation

### Documentation Hunter
Find documentation for:
- Git file deletion best practices (ensuring clean removal)
- Markdown section removal patterns (maintaining document structure)
- Claude Code agent system documentation (understanding agent architecture)
- PRP workflow documentation (verifying preserved workflow is correct)

### Example Curator
Extract examples showing:
- Clean file deletion patterns (from similar cleanup tasks)
- Documentation update patterns (removing large sections cleanly)
- Verification patterns (ensuring no broken references)
- Note: No code examples needed for this simple cleanup task

### Gotcha Detective
Investigate:
- **Git conflicts**: Uncommitted changes may conflict with deletions
  - Solution: Check git status first, stage/commit or stash changes
- **Hidden file references**: Regex patterns that might construct file names
  - Solution: Comprehensive grep for "initial-" and "create-initial"
- **Documentation coherence**: Removing large section might leave orphaned content
  - Solution: Review CLAUDE.md section transitions after edit
- **Agent naming confusion**: Users might still try to use old workflow
  - Solution: Clear documentation of the simplified workflow
- **Example file confusion**: Historical examples reference deprecated workflow
  - Solution: Add deprecation notice in example README files
