# Known Gotchas: devcontainer_vibesbox_fixes

## Overview

Five critical configuration fixes for devcontainer vibesbox integration introduce security, performance, and reliability considerations. This document identifies 12 gotchas across path normalization, Docker networking, socket permissions, volume persistence, and privileged containers. Each gotcha includes detection methods, solutions with code examples, prevention strategies, and severity ratings tied to specific fixes (1-5).

**Key Risk Areas**:
- **CRITICAL**: Host network mode security trade-offs, privileged container escape risks, Docker socket root-level access
- **HIGH**: Path mismatch causing silent failures, VNC exposure if misconfigured, socket ownership resets
- **MEDIUM**: Named volume data lifecycle, postCreateCommand debugging challenges, platform limitations
- **LOW**: Build time expectations, one-time manual setup requirements

## Critical Gotchas

### 1. Docker Host Network Mode Removes Network Isolation

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Security / Network Isolation
**Affects**: Fix #2 (VNC Network Connectivity) - `mcp-vibesbox-server/docker-compose.yml`
**Source**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35230321/, https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/

**What it is**:
When using `network_mode: host`, the container shares the Docker host's network namespace directly, eliminating network isolation between container and host. All containers using host mode can communicate with each other without firewall restrictions.

**Why it's a problem**:
- **Reduced container isolation**: Container's network stack isn't isolated from Docker host
- **Increased inter-container attack surface**: Malicious containers can exploit non-malicious containers on same host
- **Service discovery unavailable**: Cannot use Docker DNS for service names (containers must use localhost)
- **Port conflicts**: Container ports directly conflict with host services (no port mapping protection)
- **Container breakout amplification**: If container escape occurs, attacker has direct access to host network

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check if vibesbox using host network mode
docker inspect mcp-vibesbox-server | jq '.[0].HostConfig.NetworkMode'
# Should show: "host"

# Verify VNC port binding on host (not container namespace)
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 5901
# Should show direct host binding: 127.0.0.1:5901 or 0.0.0.0:5901

# Check network isolation (should see host interfaces, not isolated namespace)
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server ip addr show
# Should match host network interfaces
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Exposes VNC to all network interfaces
services:
  mcp-vibesbox-server:
    network_mode: host
    # VNC server configured with: Xvnc :1 -rfbport 5901 -rfbaddr 0.0.0.0

# ✅ RIGHT - Secure host mode with localhost binding
services:
  mcp-vibesbox-server:
    network_mode: host
    # VNC server configured with: Xvnc :1 -rfbport 5901 -rfbaddr 127.0.0.1
    # This binds VNC ONLY to localhost, preventing external access

# Verification that VNC binds to localhost only:
# Inside vibesbox container, check VNC binding
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server netstat -tlnp | grep 5901
# MUST show: 127.0.0.1:5901 (localhost only)
# NOT: 0.0.0.0:5901 (all interfaces - INSECURE)
```

**Prevention strategy**:
1. **Validate VNC localhost binding**: Add health check to verify `127.0.0.1:5901` not `0.0.0.0:5901`
2. **Document security trade-off**: This is acceptable ONLY because:
   - Vibesbox already runs privileged (container escape possible anyway)
   - VNC explicitly binds to localhost (no external network exposure)
   - Simplifies devcontainer integration (alternative requires complex bridge networking)
3. **Regular security audits**: Verify no additional services exposed via host network
4. **Host firewall configured**: Ensure host firewall blocks external access to VNC port

**Testing/validation command**:
```bash
# From devcontainer, verify VNC accessible via localhost
nc -z localhost 5901 && echo "✅ VNC accessible" || echo "❌ VNC not accessible"

# From outside host, verify VNC NOT accessible externally (should timeout)
nc -z -w 2 <host_ip> 5901 && echo "❌ SECURITY ISSUE: VNC externally accessible!" || echo "✅ VNC properly restricted"

# Verify localhost-only binding
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server bash -c "netstat -tlnp | grep 5901 | grep -q '127.0.0.1:5901' && echo '✅ Localhost only' || echo '❌ WARNING: Not localhost only'"
```

### 2. Privileged Container Enables Container Escape

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Security / Container Isolation
**Affects**: Existing vibesbox configuration (no changes in this PRP, but important context)
**Source**: https://www.startupdefense.io/cyberattacks/docker-escape, https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html

**What it is**:
Vibesbox runs with `privileged: true`, which gives the container ALL Linux kernel capabilities and complete access to host devices. This effectively disables all Docker isolation features.

**Why it's a problem**:
- **Root-level host access**: Privileged containers can mount host filesystem and modify it without restrictions
- **Kernel vulnerability exposure**: Exploits like CVE-2019-5736 (runc escape) can lead to host compromise
- **Bypassed security mechanisms**: AppArmor, SELinux, seccomp profiles all bypassed
- **Device access**: Container can access `/dev/sda1` and other host devices directly
- **Docker socket exposure risk**: Combined with `/var/run/docker.sock` mount, attacker can control entire Docker daemon

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check if container running privileged
docker inspect mcp-vibesbox-server | jq '.[0].HostConfig.Privileged'
# Should show: true (required for systemd)

# Check capabilities (privileged containers have ALL)
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server capsh --print
# Should show: Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,... (all capabilities)

# Verify host filesystem access possible
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server fdisk -l
# Should show host disk devices (confirms privileged access)
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```yaml
# ❌ CURRENT - Privileged mode required for systemd
services:
  mcp-vibesbox-server:
    privileged: true
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
      - SYS_RESOURCE

# ✅ ALTERNATIVE (if systemd not required) - Drop all, add only needed
services:
  mcp-vibesbox-server:
    privileged: false
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true

# ⚠️ MITIGATION (current approach) - Accept risk with compensating controls
# Since systemd REQUIRES privileged mode, we mitigate with:
# 1. Run container as non-root user where possible
# 2. Minimize exposed ports (VNC localhost-only)
# 3. Regular security updates
# 4. Network isolation (host mode with localhost binding)
# 5. Audit container logs for suspicious activity
```

**Prevention strategy**:
1. **Accept documented risk**: Privileged mode required for systemd-based vibesbox
2. **Compensating controls**:
   - VNC binds to localhost only (reduces external attack surface)
   - Regular security updates for base image
   - Monitor container logs for suspicious activity
   - Host firewall configured to block unauthorized access
3. **Document trade-off**: This is acceptable ONLY because:
   - Development environment (not production)
   - Systemd required for MCP server architecture
   - Alternative approaches significantly more complex
4. **Future improvement**: Consider systemd-less architecture in v2

**Testing/validation command**:
```bash
# Verify privileged mode (expected for vibesbox)
docker inspect mcp-vibesbox-server --format='{{.HostConfig.Privileged}}' && echo "⚠️ Privileged mode enabled (expected)" || echo "✅ Not privileged"

# Test if container can access host devices (expected to work)
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server ls -la /dev/sda* 2>/dev/null && echo "⚠️ Host device access enabled (expected for privileged)" || echo "✅ No host device access"

# Verify non-root user where possible
docker exec mcp-vibesbox-server whoami
# Should show: vscode (not root) for most operations

# Check security opt configuration
docker inspect mcp-vibesbox-server | jq '.[0].HostConfig.SecurityOpt'
# Should show: ["seccomp:unconfined"] (required for systemd)
```

### 3. Docker Socket Access Grants Root-Level Privileges

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Security / Privilege Escalation
**Affects**: Fix #3 (Docker Socket Permissions) - `.devcontainer/scripts/postCreate.sh`
**Source**: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/, https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

**What it is**:
Anyone who can access the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) can trivially root the entire host. Docker allows containers to mount host directories without restriction, enabling full filesystem access.

**Why it's a problem**:
- **Equivalent to sudo**: Docker group membership grants root-level privileges
- **Host filesystem accessible**: Can start containers with `-v /:/host` to access entire host filesystem
- **No audit trail**: Docker socket access doesn't require password (unlike sudo)
- **Container escape vector**: Malicious code can spawn privileged containers to escape isolation
- **chmod 777 catastrophic**: Opening socket to everyone defeats all system security

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check socket ownership and permissions
ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
# Should show: srw-rw---- 1 root docker (GID 999)
# BAD: srw-rw---- 1 root root (GID 0) - wrong group
# CATASTROPHIC: srwxrwxrwx (777) - everyone has access

# Verify user in docker group
groups | grep -q docker && echo "✅ In docker group" || echo "❌ Not in docker group"

# Test Docker access without sudo
docker ps &>/dev/null && echo "✅ Docker accessible" || echo "❌ Permission denied"

# Check for insecure permissions
[ "$(stat -c '%a' /var/run/docker.sock 2>/dev/null)" = "660" ] && echo "✅ Secure permissions" || echo "❌ WARNING: Insecure permissions"
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Security nightmare
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
# Opens socket to EVERYONE - defeats all security

# ❌ WRONG - Still insecure
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
# All users can access Docker daemon

# ✅ RIGHT - Docker group with proper permissions
# Step 1: Ensure docker group exists with correct GID
sudo groupadd -g 999 docker 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 2: Add user to docker group (in Dockerfile)
RUN usermod -aG docker vscode

# Step 3: Fix socket group ownership (in postCreate.sh)
if [ -S /var/run/docker.sock ]; then
  if sudo chgrp docker /var/run/docker.sock 2>/dev/null; then
    success "Docker socket group set to 'docker'"

    # Verify permissions (should be 660 or more restrictive)
    PERMS=$(stat -c '%a' /var/run/docker.sock)
    if [ "$PERMS" -le 660 ]; then
      success "Docker socket permissions secure: $PERMS"
    else
      warn "Docker socket permissions too open: $PERMS (should be 660 or less)"
    fi
  else
    warn "Failed to set Docker socket group - may need manual fix"
    warn "Run manually: sudo chgrp docker /var/run/docker.sock"
  fi
else
  warn "Docker socket not found - Docker access may not work"
fi

# Step 4: Verify access immediately
if docker ps &>/dev/null; then
  success "Docker access verified"
else
  error "Docker access failed - check socket permissions and group membership"
fi
```

**Prevention strategy**:
1. **Automated permission fix**: Always run `sudo chgrp docker /var/run/docker.sock` in postCreate.sh
2. **Idempotent operations**: Use `|| true` pattern so safe to run multiple times
3. **Security awareness**: Document that docker group = root-level privileges
4. **Alternative for production**: Consider Docker Rootless mode for production environments
5. **Principle of least privilege**: Only grant Docker access to users who absolutely need it
6. **Audit logging**: Enable Docker daemon audit logging for security-sensitive environments

**Testing/validation command**:
```bash
# Comprehensive socket permission check
check_docker_socket() {
  echo "Checking Docker socket permissions..."

  # Check existence
  if [ ! -S /var/run/docker.sock ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Docker socket not found"
    return 1
  fi

  # Check ownership
  local owner_group=$(ls -l /var/run/docker.sock | awk '{print $3":"$4}')
  if [ "$owner_group" = "root:docker" ]; then
    echo "✅ Socket ownership correct: $owner_group"
  else
    echo "❌ WARNING: Socket ownership incorrect: $owner_group (should be root:docker)"
  fi

  # Check permissions
  local perms=$(stat -c '%a' /var/run/docker.sock)
  if [ "$perms" -le 660 ]; then
    echo "✅ Socket permissions secure: $perms"
  else
    echo "❌ WARNING: Socket permissions too open: $perms (should be 660 or less)"
  fi

  # Check group membership
  if groups | grep -q docker; then
    echo "✅ User in docker group"
  else
    echo "❌ ERROR: User not in docker group"
  fi

  # Test access
  if docker ps &>/dev/null; then
    echo "✅ Docker access works"
    return 0
  else
    echo "❌ ERROR: Docker access denied"
    return 1
  fi
}

## High Priority Gotchas

### 4. Path Mismatch Causes Silent postCreateCommand Failures

**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Configuration / Debugging
**Affects**: Fix #1 (Path Normalization) - All `.devcontainer/` files
**Source**: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6206, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65909781/

**What it is**:
When `working_dir` is `/workspace/vibes` but volume mount is `../:/workspace`, scripts reference non-existent paths like `/workspace/vibes/.devcontainer/scripts/postCreate.sh`. postCreateCommand fails but container still starts, appearing healthy with incomplete setup.

**Why it's a problem**:
- **Silent failures**: Container appears healthy but vibesbox setup incomplete
- **Hard to debug**: Logs don't clearly indicate postCreateCommand failure (exit code 127 "file not found")
- **Subsequent commands skipped**: If postCreateCommand fails, postStartCommand never runs
- **Manual workarounds required**: User must run setup scripts manually after container starts
- **Inconsistent state**: Some features work (devcontainer opens) but others don't (vibesbox unavailable)

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check if working_dir matches volume mount structure
docker inspect devcontainer | jq '.[0].Config.WorkingDir'
# Should show: "/workspace" (matches volume mount target)
# BAD: "/workspace/vibes" (doesn't exist - volume is at /workspace)

# Verify actual directory structure
docker exec devcontainer pwd
# Should show: /workspace

# Check if .devcontainer accessible at expected path
docker exec devcontainer ls -la /workspace/.devcontainer/scripts/postCreate.sh
# Should succeed (file exists)
# BAD: "No such file or directory" (path mismatch)

# Check postCreateCommand logs for exit code 127 (file not found)
# VS Code: "Dev Containers Developer: Show all logs..." → search "postCreateCommand"
# Look for: "postCreateCommand failed with exit code 127"
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - working_dir doesn't match volume mount structure
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  devcontainer:
    volumes:
      - ../:/workspace:cached  # Repository root mounted to /workspace
    working_dir: /workspace/vibes  # ERROR: /workspace/vibes doesn't exist!

# ✅ RIGHT - working_dir matches volume mount
services:
  devcontainer:
    volumes:
      - ../:/workspace:cached  # Repository root mounted to /workspace
    working_dir: /workspace  # Matches volume mount target
```

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - postCreate.sh with incorrect paths
if [ -f /workspace/vibes/.devcontainer/scripts/install-vibesbox-cli.sh ]; then
  source /workspace/vibes/.devcontainer/scripts/install-vibesbox-cli.sh
fi

# ✅ RIGHT - postCreate.sh with correct paths
if [ -f /workspace/.devcontainer/scripts/install-vibesbox-cli.sh ]; then
  source /workspace/.devcontainer/scripts/install-vibesbox-cli.sh
else
  error "ERROR: install-vibesbox-cli.sh not found at expected path"
  error "Expected: /workspace/.devcontainer/scripts/install-vibesbox-cli.sh"
  error "Current working directory: $(pwd)"
  error "Available files: $(ls -la /workspace/.devcontainer/scripts/ 2>&1)"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Prevention strategy**:
1. **Validate paths early**: Add existence checks before sourcing scripts
2. **Explicit error messages**: Show expected vs actual paths when files not found
3. **Debug output**: Print working directory and file listings when errors occur
4. **Test configuration**: Use `docker-compose config` to verify resolved paths
5. **Document mount structure**: Clearly document volume mount → working_dir relationship

**Testing/validation command**: See comprehensive validation function in documentation-links.md

**Example from codebase**:
See DEVCONTAINER_TEST_RESULTS.md lines 162-177 showing exact error from path mismatch

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #1 (Path Normalization)

### 5. Docker Socket Group Ownership Resets After Daemon Restart

**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Permissions / Configuration
**Affects**: Fix #3 (Docker Socket Permissions) - postCreate.sh automation
**Source**: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1194205/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48568172/

**What it is**:
Docker socket may be owned by `root:root` (GID 0) instead of `root:docker` (GID 999) after Docker daemon restart or system reboot. This breaks non-root Docker access until manually fixed with `sudo chgrp docker /var/run/docker.sock`.

**Why it's a problem**:
- **Manual intervention required**: User must run `sudo chgrp` after every devcontainer rebuild or daemon restart
- **Permission denied errors**: All Docker commands fail with "permission denied" until fixed
- **Inconsistent state**: Works initially, breaks after restart
- **Poor user experience**: Frustrating for developers who don't understand root cause
- **Not well documented**: Docker documentation doesn't explain why this happens

**How to detect it**: See codebase-patterns.md for detection commands

**How to avoid/fix**: See comprehensive fix in codebase-patterns.md lines 99-147

**Prevention strategy**: Automated fix in postCreate.sh with idempotent design

**Testing/validation command**: Socket permission automation test provided in codebase-patterns.md

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #3 (Docker Socket Permissions)

---

### 6. network_mode: host Conflicts with ports and networks Sections

**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Configuration / Docker Compose
**Affects**: Fix #2 (VNC Network Connectivity) - `mcp-vibesbox-server/docker-compose.yml`
**Source**: https://forums.docker.com/t/option-network-mode-host-in-docker-compose-file-not-working-as-expected/51682

**What it is**:
Docker Compose validation error occurs when `network_mode: host` is combined with `ports:` or `networks:` sections. These options are mutually exclusive because host mode bypasses Docker's network stack entirely.

**Why it's a problem**:
- **Compose startup fails**: Docker Compose refuses to start with validation error
- **Non-obvious error message**: Error doesn't clearly explain incompatibility
- **Configuration confusion**: Users expect port mapping to work with host mode
- **Breaking change**: Migration from bridge to host requires removing multiple sections
- **Documentation sparse**: Docker Compose docs don't emphasize this restriction clearly

**How to detect it**: See validation script in codebase-patterns.md lines 307-352

**How to avoid/fix**: See migration pattern in codebase-patterns.md lines 268-326

**Prevention strategy**: Pre-migration validation with `docker compose config`

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #2 (VNC Network Connectivity)

## Medium Priority Gotchas

### 7. Named Volumes Persist Independently of Containers

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Data Lifecycle / Storage
**Affects**: Fix #4 (Claude Auth Persistence) - claude-auth volume
**Source**: https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79246538/

**What it is**:
Named volumes persist beyond container lifecycle. Data remains even after `docker compose down` or container deletion. Requires explicit `docker volume rm` to delete.

**Why it's confusing**:
- **Unexpected persistence**: Developers expect `docker compose down` to clean up everything
- **Storage accumulation**: Old volumes accumulate over time, consuming disk space
- **Credential leakage**: Sensitive data (like Claude auth tokens) persists across projects
- **Debugging challenges**: Stale data in volumes can cause confusing behavior
- **No automatic cleanup**: Must manually track and remove unused volumes

**How to handle it**: See comprehensive volume management in documentation-links.md

**Workaround for credential management**: Named volume with one-time setup process

**Prevention strategy**: Document persistence, provide cleanup instructions, backup strategy

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #4 (Claude Auth Persistence)

---

### 8. postCreateCommand Failures Are Silent and Hard to Debug

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Debugging / Developer Experience
**Affects**: Fix #1 (Path Normalization) - postCreate.sh failures
**Source**: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6206

**What it is**:
If postCreateCommand has non-zero exit code, VS Code Dev Containers still opens but setup is incomplete. Logs don't prominently show the failure. postStartCommand and subsequent lifecycle scripts are skipped.

**Why it's confusing**:
- **Container appears healthy**: Dev Container opens normally, hiding failure
- **Subtle error indicators**: Logs show failure but not in obvious location
- **Subsequent scripts skipped**: postStartCommand never runs if postCreateCommand fails
- **Manual workarounds needed**: Developer must re-run failed scripts manually
- **Scripts work when run manually**: Confusing when same script works outside lifecycle

**How to detect it**: View VS Code Dev Container logs, look for exit code indicators

**How to handle it**: See comprehensive error handling pattern in codebase-patterns.md

**Prevention strategy**: Validate paths early, explicit error messages, completion marker

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #1 (Path Normalization), Fix #5 (Validation)

---

### 9. VNC Display Race Condition (ALREADY SOLVED)

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Timing / Initialization
**Affects**: Existing vibesbox implementation (no changes needed)
**Source**: Previous PRP implementation, vibesbox-functions.sh health checks

**What it is**:
x11vnc starts before Xvfb display ready, causing "Can't open display :1" errors. VNC server fails to bind until X11 display socket exists.

**Why it's documented**:
This gotcha is **ALREADY SOLVED** in existing implementation via polling loop in ensure-vibesbox.sh. Documenting here to prevent regression.

**How it was solved**: See wait_for_condition pattern in codebase-patterns.md

**DO NOT CHANGE**: This implementation works correctly - keep as-is.

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Reference only - no changes needed

---

## Low Priority Gotchas

### 10. Platform Limitations - Host Network Mode Linux-Only

**Severity**: LOW
**Category**: Platform Compatibility
**Affects**: Fix #2 (VNC Network Connectivity)
**Source**: https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/tutorials/host/

**What it is**:
Host networking "only works on Linux hosts" according to Docker docs. Mac/Windows require Docker Desktop 4.34+ with explicit opt-in.

**Why it's a minor concern**:
- Development environments typically Linux
- Docker Desktop support added in 4.34+
- Workaround exists (bridge networking)
- Documentation clear on limitation

**How to handle**: Use bridge networking on non-Linux if needed

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #2 (VNC Network Connectivity)

---

### 11. ARM64 Build Time Longer Than Expected

**Severity**: LOW
**Category**: Performance / Documentation
**Affects**: User expectations
**Source**: DEVCONTAINER_TEST_RESULTS.md

**What it is**:
Vibesbox image build takes >180s on ARM64 (Apple Silicon), not 120s as originally estimated.

**How to handle**: Update documentation with accurate build times, increase health check timeouts on ARM64

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Documentation update for Fix #5

---

### 12. One-Time Claude Auth Setup Required After First Rebuild

**Severity**: LOW
**Category**: User Experience / Manual Setup
**Affects**: Fix #4 (Claude Auth Persistence)
**Source**: CLAUDE_AUTH_CROSS_PLATFORM.md

**What it is**:
After first devcontainer rebuild with claude-auth volume, user must manually run `claude auth login` once. Credentials persist in named volume for subsequent rebuilds.

**Why it's acceptable**:
- One-time operation only
- Industry standard practice
- Better than alternatives (env vars insecure, host mounts have path issues)
- Clear documentation via postCreate.sh output

**How to handle**: Document setup steps in postCreate.sh output

**Relevance to specific fixes**: Fix #4 (Claude Auth Persistence)

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

When generating the PRP:

1. **Include in "Known Gotchas & Library Quirks" Section**: Critical (#1-3), High (#4-6), Medium (#7-9), Low (#10-12)

2. **Reference Solutions in "Implementation Blueprint"**: Include detection methods and mitigation code

3. **Add Detection Tests to Validation Gates**: Security, configuration, and data persistence validation

4. **Warn About Version Issues**: Docker Desktop 4.34+ for host mode on Mac/Windows

5. **Highlight Anti-Patterns**: chmod 777, network_mode conflicts, working_dir mismatch
