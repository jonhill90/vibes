# Examples Curated: initial_factory_removal

## Summary
Extracted 4 code examples to `examples/initial_factory_removal/` directory showing the structure of files to be deleted and clean deletion patterns from git history.

## Files Created
1. **example_1_agent_structure.md**: Full prp-initial-feature-clarifier.md agent file structure (what we're deleting)
2. **example_2_command_structure.md**: Full create-initial.md command file structure (orchestrator we're removing)
3. **example_3_documentation_section.md**: CLAUDE.md lines 185-378 (exact section to remove)
4. **example_4_cleanup_commit_pattern.md**: Git history patterns from commits 2b91ff6 and 0a92e5c (how to execute clean deletions)
5. **README.md**: Comprehensive guide with "what to mimic/adapt/skip" for each example

## Key Patterns Extracted

### Pattern 1: Agent File Structure (Example 1)
- **From**: .claude/agents/prp-initial-feature-clarifier.md
- **Pattern**: YAML frontmatter + structured markdown sections
- **Relevance**: Shows what all 6 prp-initial-* agent files look like
- **Key Insight**: Each agent is ~300 lines with consistent structure
- **Usage**: Understand what we're deleting (6 files × 300 lines = 1,800 lines)

### Pattern 2: Command Orchestration (Example 2)
- **From**: .claude/commands/create-initial.md
- **Pattern**: Multi-phase workflow with subagent invocation and Archon integration
- **Relevance**: This is the entry point to the factory workflow
- **Key Insight**: 531 lines orchestrating 6 subagents across 5 phases
- **Usage**: Removing this eliminates the /create-initial command completely

### Pattern 3: Documentation Section Removal (Example 3)
- **From**: CLAUDE.md lines 185-378
- **Pattern**: Large markdown section with clear boundaries
- **Relevance**: Exact section to remove from documentation
- **Key Insight**: 193 lines bounded by "---" separators, line 179 preserved, line 380 is next section
- **Usage**: Surgical removal without orphaning content

### Pattern 4: Clean Deletion Commits (Example 4)
- **From**: git history (commits 2b91ff6, 0a92e5c)
- **Pattern**: Simple commit messages, complete file deletion, no backups
- **Relevance**: Proven patterns from this repository
- **Key Insight**: "cleanup" or "Concept removed." messages, trust git history, 3K-15K lines deleted confidently
- **Usage**: Execute our deletion following same proven patterns

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

### 1. Reference Examples in "All Needed Context"
Include all 4 examples in the PRP:
- Example 1: Shows structure of agents to delete
- Example 2: Shows command file to delete
- Example 3: Shows exact CLAUDE.md lines to remove
- Example 4: Shows how to commit the changes

### 2. Use Examples for Implementation Blueprint
**Task 1: Delete Agent Files**
- Reference: Example 1 (shows what we're deleting)
- Action: `git rm .claude/agents/prp-initial-*.md` (6 files)

**Task 2: Delete Command File**
- Reference: Example 2 (shows orchestrator structure)
- Action: `git rm .claude/commands/create-initial.md`

**Task 3: Remove Documentation Section**
- Reference: Example 3 (shows exact lines)
- Action: Remove lines 185-378 from CLAUDE.md, preserve line 379

**Task 4: Verify and Commit**
- Reference: Example 4 (shows commit patterns)
- Action: Grep for references, commit with simple message

### 3. Include Verification Steps
Based on examples, verification should check:
- No prp-initial-* files remain in .claude/agents/
- No create-initial.md in .claude/commands/
- CLAUDE.md line count reduced by ~193 lines
- No grep hits for "prp-initial-" or "create-initial"
- Section transition is clean (line before "---", line after "## Development Patterns")

### 4. Use Examples for Quality Gates
**Gate 1: File Deletion Complete**
- Count: 6 agent files + 1 command file = 7 files removed
- Verification: `ls .claude/agents/prp-initial-*` returns no results
- Verification: `ls .claude/commands/create-initial.md` returns no results

**Gate 2: Documentation Updated**
- Lines removed: 193 (from 185-378)
- Verification: CLAUDE.md renders without gaps
- Verification: "INITIAL.md Factory Workflow" heading not found

**Gate 3: No Broken References**
- Verification: `grep -r "prp-initial-" .claude/` returns no results
- Verification: `grep "create-initial" CLAUDE.md` returns no results
- Verification: `grep "INITIAL.md Factory" CLAUDE.md` returns no results

**Gate 4: Clean Commit**
- Pattern: Follow Example 4 (simple message, complete deletion)
- Message: "Remove INITIAL factory workflow" or "cleanup"
- No backup files created

## Quality Assessment

### Coverage: How well examples cover requirements (10/10)
- ✅ Shows exactly what we're deleting (agent files, command file, doc section)
- ✅ Shows exact line numbers for documentation removal
- ✅ Shows proven commit patterns from this repository
- ✅ Provides complete structure understanding

### Relevance: How applicable to feature (10/10)
- ✅ Example 1: Exact agent file structure we're removing
- ✅ Example 2: Exact command file we're removing
- ✅ Example 3: Exact documentation section we're removing
- ✅ Example 4: Proven deletion patterns from this codebase

### Completeness: Are examples self-contained? (10/10)
- ✅ Each example has source attribution
- ✅ Each example has relevance score
- ✅ README provides comprehensive "what to mimic/adapt/skip"
- ✅ All files extracted (not just references)
- ✅ Pattern highlights explain key techniques

### Overall: 10/10

## Special Notes for Assembler

### Deletion Scope (from examples):
- **Total Files**: 7 (6 agents + 1 command)
- **Total Lines**: ~2,524 lines
  - Agent files: ~1,800 lines (6 × 300)
  - Command file: 531 lines
  - Documentation: 193 lines

### Preservation (critical):
- **Keep**: All prp-gen-* agents (6 files)
- **Keep**: All prp-exec-* agents (4 files)
- **Keep**: /generate-prp and /execute-prp commands
- **Keep**: Line 179 (---) and line 380+ (next section) in CLAUDE.md
- **Keep**: Historical examples in examples/ directory

### Commit Pattern (from Example 4):
```bash
# Step 1: Delete files
git rm .claude/agents/prp-initial-*.md
git rm .claude/commands/create-initial.md

# Step 2: Edit CLAUDE.md (remove lines 185-378)
# Use text editor or sed

# Step 3: Verify no references
grep -r "prp-initial-" .claude/  # Should return nothing
grep "create-initial" CLAUDE.md  # Should return nothing

# Step 4: Commit
git commit -m "Remove INITIAL factory workflow"

# Expected result: ~2,500 lines deleted, clean commit
```

### Example-Driven Implementation:
1. **Study Phase**: Read all 4 examples + README (5-10 minutes)
2. **Deletion Phase**: Execute based on Example 4 patterns (5 minutes)
3. **Verification Phase**: Grep checks from examples (5 minutes)
4. **Commit Phase**: Simple message like Example 4 (1 minute)
5. **Total**: 15-20 minutes

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **Examples Extracted**: 4 files + README (target: 2-4)
- ✅ **Quality Score**: 10/10 (target: 8+/10)
- ✅ **Coverage**: Complete understanding of deletion scope
- ✅ **Actionability**: Clear patterns for each task
- ✅ **Verification**: Specific grep commands for validation
