**Size**: 63 lines (with detailed pattern explanation)
**Relevance**: 10/10 - Critical prerequisite pattern for vibesbox startup
**Extraction Status**: ✅ Complete

**Pattern Demonstrated**:
Check-before-create pattern for idempotent Docker network operations, handling "already exists" as success case.

**Guidance Added**:
- What to mimic: ✅ Check-then-create pattern, stderr redirection, "already exists" as success
- What to adapt: ✅ Make network name configurable, use as prerequisite in ensure-vibesbox.sh
- What to skip: ✅ Container connection logic (vibesbox manages own network)

- What to mimic: ✅ Small helper functions, docker ps vs docker ps -a, docker inspect for details, case-based dispatch
- What to adapt: ✅ Extend with VNC/screenshot checks, make container name configurable
- What to skip: ✅ Docker healthcheck (vibesbox doesn't define it - use custom checks)
- Pattern highlights: ✅ Code snippets showing state detection and action dispatch

**Relevance**: 10/10 - The ACTUAL configuration being automated
**Extraction Status**: ✅ Complete

**Pattern Demonstrated**:
Docker Compose configuration for systemd container with external network, VNC port binding, and privileged mode requirements.

**Guidance Added**:
- What to mimic: ✅ Use docker compose commands, check for external network first, understand systemd requirements
- What to adapt: ✅ Working directory for compose commands, network prerequisite checks, build vs start logic
- What to skip: ✅ Don't modify compose file, don't use docker run, don't change container name

## Archon Examples Used

**No Archon examples were used** - All examples extracted from local codebase.

**Reasoning**:
- Archon search returned Python/AI framework examples (not relevant to bash scripting)
- Local codebase has excellent existing patterns in `.devcontainer/scripts/`
- Existing scripts are production-tested and highly relevant (9-10/10 relevance)

## Local Files Used

| File Path | Lines | Pattern Type | Relevance |
|-----------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| `.devcontainer/scripts/postCreate.sh` | 8-12 | Helper functions | 10/10 |
| `.devcontainer/scripts/test-docker.sh` | 7-56 | Health checks | 9/10 |
| `.devcontainer/scripts/setup-network.sh` | 1-26 | Network management | 10/10 |
| `mcp/mcp-vibesbox-server/docker-compose.yml` | 1-35 | Container config | 10/10 |
| Synthesized from multiple scripts | N/A | State detection | 10/10 |
| Synthesized from multiple scripts | N/A | Polling pattern | 9/10 |

## Code Extraction Details

### Extraction Method

**Local Files**:
- Used Read tool to access source files
- Extracted relevant code sections with context
- Preserved original formatting and indentation
- Added source attribution as header comments
- Added extensive "what to mimic" guidance as comments

**Synthesized Patterns**:
- Combined patterns from multiple source files
- Created complete, executable examples
- Documented pattern origins in comments
- Provided usage examples within the code

**Archon Examples**:
- Searched Archon for bash health checks, docker lifecycle, CLI patterns
- Results were Python/AI frameworks (not applicable)
- Decided local examples were superior match for bash scripting needs

### Quality Checks Performed

- ✅ Code syntax valid (bash scripts are executable)
- ✅ Examples complete (no truncated code - full working examples)
- ✅ Source attribution added (file path, line numbers, pattern description)
- ✅ Pattern clearly demonstrated (each example shows one clear pattern)
- ✅ Relevance score assigned (9-10/10 for all examples)
- ✅ Comprehensive guidance added (what to mimic/adapt/skip for each)
- ✅ Usage examples included (shows how to apply pattern)

## Usage in INITIAL.md

The assembler should reference the examples directory like this:

```markdown
## EXAMPLES:

### Example Usage Guidance:

Each example includes:

- **What to adapt** (how to modify for this feature)
- **What to skip** (irrelevant parts for this context)
- **Pattern highlights** (code snippets showing key techniques)
- **Why this example** (relevance explanation)

### Recommended Implementation Flow:

1. **Start with helper-functions.sh** - Source these in all scripts for consistent output
2. **Use network-setup.sh pattern** - Ensure vibes-network exists before starting vibesbox
3. **Apply container-state-detection.sh** - Detect state and determine action (build/start/check)
4. **Follow vibesbox-docker-compose.yml** - Use docker compose commands for lifecycle management
5. **Use polling-with-timeout.sh** - Wait for container/VNC/screenshot readiness
6. **Apply docker-health-check.sh** - Validate full stack before declaring "ready"

### Integration Pattern:

```bash
# ensure-vibesbox.sh structure
source helper-functions.sh
ensure_network()              # network-setup.sh pattern
detect_state()                # container-state-detection.sh pattern
case "$STATE" in
    missing) build ;;         # vibesbox-docker-compose.yml reference
    stopped) start ;;         # docker compose up -d
    running) check ;;         # continue to health checks
esac
wait_for_vibesbox()           # polling-with-timeout.sh pattern
health_check()                # docker-health-check.sh pattern
report_status()               # helper-functions.sh usage
```
```

## Statistics

- **Total Files Created**: 7 (6 code files + 1 README)
- **Total Lines Extracted**: ~550 lines (including documentation)
- **Archon Examples**: 0 (local examples were superior)
- **Local Examples**: 4 (2 synthesized patterns)
- **Test Examples**: 0 (integration tests will be created during implementation)
- **Average Relevance**: 9.7/10

## Gaps & Notes

### No Critical Gaps

All necessary patterns were found in the local codebase:
- ✅ CLI output helpers (postCreate.sh)
- ✅ Docker health checks (test-docker.sh)
- ✅ Network management (setup-network.sh)
- ✅ Docker Compose reference (vibesbox compose file)
- ✅ State detection pattern (synthesized from docker usage)
- ✅ Polling pattern (synthesized from health check patterns)

### Additional Notes

1. **Synthesized Patterns Justified**:
   - No single file demonstrated complete state detection or polling patterns
   - Combined knowledge from multiple sources into complete, executable examples
   - This is MORE valuable than code references (provides working implementations)

2. **Local > Archon for Bash**:
   - Archon search returned Python/AI framework examples
   - Local codebase has production-tested bash patterns
   - Existing scripts solve nearly identical problems (Docker container lifecycle in devcontainer)
   - Relevance scores: Local 9-10/10 vs Archon 1-2/10

3. **Example Quality**:
   - All examples are executable bash scripts (not snippets)
   - Extensive inline documentation (what to mimic/adapt/skip)
   - Real-world patterns from production use
   - Directly applicable to feature requirements

4. **README Comprehensiveness**:
   - 350+ line guide with detailed analysis of each example
   - Pattern summary section (common patterns across examples)
   - Integration notes (how examples relate to feature)
   - Quick reference (when to use each pattern)
   - Gaps documentation (what examples don't cover)

5. **Implementation Readiness**:
   - Developer can follow examples directly
   - Clear guidance on adaptation needed
   - Integration pattern provided
   - Flow diagram shows example usage order

### Recommendations for Assembler

When creating INITIAL.md:

1. **Reference examples directory prominently** - These are high-quality, directly applicable patterns
2. **Include integration pattern from README** - Shows how to combine examples
3. **Highlight helper-functions.sh** - Foundation for all scripts
4. **Emphasize idempotency** - Pattern appears in multiple examples for good reason
5. **Reference vibesbox-docker-compose.yml** - The actual config being automated

### Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Study order**: helper-functions → network-setup → container-state-detection → polling → health-check → compose
2. **Start with ensure-vibesbox.sh**: Combine patterns from examples
3. **Create vibesbox-helpers.sh**: Extract shared functions (state detection, polling)
4. **Test incrementally**: Each pattern independently before integration
5. **Add CLI commands last**: vibesbox-status, vibesbox-start, etc. (use helper functions)
