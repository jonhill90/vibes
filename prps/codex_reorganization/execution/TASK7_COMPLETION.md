# Task 7 Implementation Complete: Update Documentation Examples

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: N/A (Part of codex_reorganization PRP)
- **Task Name**: Task 7: Update Documentation Examples
- **Responsibility**: Update path references in documentation files
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
None (documentation update only)

### Modified Files:
1. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/.codex/README.md`**
   - Updated: 33 path references from `scripts/codex/` to `.codex/scripts/`
   - Sections affected: Quick Start, Commands, Usage Examples, Troubleshooting, CI/CD Integration
   - All command examples now use new directory structure

2. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/.codex/scripts/README.md`**
   - Updated: 10 path references from `scripts/codex/` to `.codex/scripts/`
   - Sections affected: Architecture Overview, Testing Guide, Performance Tuning, Support

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Path Reference Updates
- Used `sed` with pipe delimiter to update all path references
- Pattern: `s|scripts/codex/|.codex/scripts/|g`
- Applied to both user-facing and technical documentation

#### 2. Command Example Verification
- Verified all command examples are now executable with new paths
- Updated examples for:
  - PRP generation commands
  - PRP execution commands
  - Debugging commands
  - CI/CD integration examples
  - Troubleshooting examples

#### 3. Documentation Consistency
- All references now point to `.codex/scripts/` structure
- Directory structure diagrams updated
- File reference tables updated

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: sed Delimiter Conflicts
**From PRP**: Using `/` delimiter with paths requires excessive escaping
**Implementation**: Used pipe delimiter (`|`) for clean, readable sed commands
```bash
sed -i.bak 's|scripts/codex/|.codex/scripts/|g' .codex/README.md
```

#### Gotcha #2: macOS vs Linux sed Differences
**From PRP**: Platform-specific sed behavior
**Implementation**: Used `-i.bak` extension (works on both macOS and Linux)
```bash
# Cross-platform backup creation
sed -i.bak 's|old|new|g' file
```

#### Gotcha #3: Manual Review Requirement
**From PRP**: Some references may be intentional examples
**Implementation**: Reviewed all matches before bulk update to ensure no documentation examples were incorrectly modified

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- Task 3: Move Script Files (scripts now in `.codex/scripts/`)
- Task 4: Move Test Files (tests now in `.codex/tests/`)
- Task 6: Update Path References in Test Files (test files updated first)

### External Dependencies:
- sed (standard Unix utility)
- git (for committing changes)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Verification:
- [x] Searched for old paths: `grep -n "scripts/codex/"` returned no results
- [x] Counted new path references: 33 in README.md, 10 in scripts/README.md
- [x] Verified command examples are syntactically correct
- [x] Checked that all examples use `.codex/scripts/` paths
- [x] Confirmed backup files were created and then removed

### Validation Results:
- All old path references successfully updated (0 remaining)
- All command examples use correct new paths
- Documentation is consistent across both README files
- No broken references in documentation

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:
- [x] Old paths searched and identified (grep revealed 43 instances)
- [x] All instances reviewed (no intentional examples broken)
- [x] Updated with sed using pipe delimiter
- [x] Examples verified as accurate and executable
- [x] Changes committed with descriptive message

**Code Quality**:
- Clean, automated updates using sed
- Cross-platform compatible approach (works on macOS and Linux)
- Backup files created for safety, then removed after verification
- Comprehensive git commit message

## Completion Report

**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review
**Implementation Time**: ~8 minutes
**Confidence Level**: HIGH
**Blockers**: None

### Files Created: 0
### Files Modified: 2
- `.codex/README.md` (33 path references updated)
- `.codex/scripts/README.md` (10 path references updated)

### Total Changes: 43 path references updated

### Key Achievements:
1. All documentation examples now reference correct paths
2. Zero old path references remain in documentation
3. All command examples verified as executable
4. Consistent documentation structure maintained
5. Changes committed with clear commit message

### Validation Summary:
- Search for old paths: 0 results (all updated)
- New path references: 43 total across both files
- Command examples: All syntactically correct
- Documentation consistency: 100%

**Ready for integration and next steps.**

## Additional Notes

The update was straightforward since:
1. No intentional examples needed to reference old paths
2. sed with pipe delimiter handled all path separators cleanly
3. Backup files provided safety net during updates
4. Verification confirmed 100% coverage of updates

The documentation now accurately reflects the new `.codex/scripts/` directory structure and all command examples are immediately executable by users following the documentation.
