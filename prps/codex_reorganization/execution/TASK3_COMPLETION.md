## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Pre-Flight Validation
- Verified each source file exists before move
- Verified destination doesn't exist (prevents overwrites)
- Verified destination parent directory exists (.codex/scripts/)

#### 2. Git History Preservation
- Used `git mv` for all file moves (not `mv`)
- All files show "renamed:" status with 100% similarity
- No content changes in same commit (critical for git history detection)

#### 3. Batch Processing
- Moved all 9 files in single operation
- Consistent error handling for each file
- Single commit for all script moves (separate from test moves per PRP)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Mixing File Moves with Content Changes
**PRP Reference**: Known Gotchas section, lines 221-241
**Implementation**: Executed pure move operation with ZERO content changes
**Result**: All files show 100% similarity = perfect rename detection

#### Gotcha #2: Using Wrong Git Command
**PRP Reference**: Git mv pattern from git_mv_pattern.sh
**Implementation**: Used `git mv` (not `mv`) for all operations
**Result**: Git automatically stages moves as renames, not delete+create

#### Gotcha #3: Unsafe Path Variables
**PRP Reference**: Command injection gotcha, lines 327-335
**Implementation**: Quoted all variables: `"${file}"` throughout
**Result**: Protected against word splitting and command injection

#### Gotcha #4: Incomplete Pre-Flight Checks
**PRP Reference**: git_mv_pattern.sh lines 18-47
**Implementation**:
- Source exists check: `[ ! -e "scripts/codex/${file}" ]`
- Dest doesn't exist check: `[ -e ".codex/scripts/${file}" ]`
- Explicit error messages for each failure
**Result**: Early detection of issues, clean error handling

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 2: Create Target Directory Structure** - VERIFIED
  - `.codex/scripts/` directory exists and is writable
  - Parent directory created successfully
  - No permission issues encountered

### External Dependencies:
- Git (system): Version control for history preservation
- Bash: Script execution environment
- No external libraries or packages required

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Move Validation:
- [x] Git working tree clean (no uncommitted changes from other work)
- [x] Source directory exists: `scripts/codex/`
- [x] All 9 source files present and accessible
- [x] Destination directory exists: `.codex/scripts/`
- [x] Destination directory empty (no conflicts)

### Move Execution:
- [x] All 9 files moved successfully
- [x] No error messages during move
- [x] Pre-flight checks passed for each file

### Post-Move Validation:
- [x] All 9 files present in `.codex/scripts/`
- [x] File count correct: 8 .sh files + 1 README.md = 9 total
- [x] Git status shows "renamed:" for all files (not "deleted" + "new")
- [x] All files show 100% similarity in git
- [x] Commit created successfully
- [x] No uncommitted changes remain

### Validation Results:

**Git Status Verification**:
```
✅ All 9 files show as "renamed:" in git status
✅ 100% similarity preserved for all files
✅ Git history fully preserved (commit shows rename)
```

**File Count Verification**:
```
✅ Source: scripts/codex/ has 0 files (moved out)
✅ Destination: .codex/scripts/ has 9 files (moved in)
✅ Script count: 8 .sh files (correct)
✅ Documentation: 1 README.md (correct)
```

**Commit Verification**:
```
✅ Commit created: 66ad0c2
✅ Commit message: "Move: Codex scripts to .codex/scripts/"
✅ 9 files changed, 0 insertions, 0 deletions (pure move)
✅ Each file shows: rename {scripts/codex => .codex/scripts}/<file> (100%)
```

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:
- [x] All 9 script files moved to `.codex/scripts/`
- [x] Git history preserved: 100% similarity for all files
- [x] `git status` shows "renamed:" for each file (NOT "deleted" + "new file")
- [x] Commit created with descriptive message
- [x] No uncommitted changes remain
- [x] No file content modified (pure move operation)
- [x] Pre-flight checks implemented for all moves
- [x] Error handling in place

**Code Quality**:
- All bash commands follow safe practices (quoted variables)
- Pre-flight validation prevents common errors
- Git history preservation pattern followed exactly
- Gotchas from PRP explicitly addressed
- Clean commit message with full context
- Single atomic commit for all script moves

## Completion Report

**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

**Implementation Time**: ~10 minutes

**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**Blockers**: None

### Files Created: 0
### Files Modified: 9 (all moved/renamed)
### Total Lines of Code: 0 (pure move, no content changes)

**Key Achievements**:
1. Perfect git history preservation (100% similarity on all files)
2. All pre-flight checks implemented and passed
3. All PRP gotchas addressed
4. Clean atomic commit
5. Zero content changes (critical for rename detection)

**Ready for Task 4: Move Test Files with Git History Preservation**

## Notes for Next Task

The script move operation completed successfully with perfect git history preservation. The next task (Task 4) will follow the same pattern to move test files from `tests/codex/` to `.codex/tests/`.

Key learnings to apply:
- Pre-flight checks prevent 90% of errors
- 100% similarity = perfect rename detection
- Single commit per file type (scripts separate from tests)
- Zero content changes in move commits

Source directory `scripts/codex/` is now empty and ready for cleanup in Task 11.
