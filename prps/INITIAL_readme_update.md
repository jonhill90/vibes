# INITIAL: Update README.md Post-Context Refactor

## What I Want

Update README.md to accurately reflect the current state of the Vibes project after the successful context refactor (59-70% token reduction). The README is outdated and doesn't mention:

1. **Archon MCP Server** - Our primary task/knowledge management system (currently live)
2. **Context Optimization Success** - 59-70% reduction achieved, pattern library created
3. **Simplified .claude/ Structure** - Commands, patterns, agents, templates
4. **Updated MCP Server List** - Missing: archon, basic-memory, MCP_DOCKER
5. **Pattern Library Section** - New reusable workflow patterns (archon-workflow, parallel-subagents, quality-gates, security-validation)
6. **Actual Line Counts** - CLAUDE.md: 107 lines, patterns: 120-150 lines, commands: 200-320 lines

## Current Problems

- README lists only 2 MCP servers (vibes, vibesbox) but config has 4 (+ archon, basic-memory)
- No mention of Archon integration despite it being critical to workflow
- Missing context optimization achievements (major accomplishment!)
- Directory structure shows old `prps/` layout, doesn't explain `.claude/`
- "Current Capabilities" section is vague and outdated
- No mention of pattern library or how to use it

## What Success Looks Like

**Updated README.md that:**
- Lists all 4 active MCP servers with purposes
- Has "Context Optimization" section showing 59-70% reduction results
- Explains `.claude/` directory (commands, patterns, agents, templates)
- Updates "Current Capabilities" to be specific about Archon task management
- Adds "Pattern Library" section referencing `.claude/patterns/README.md`
- Keeps same friendly tone and "conversational development" philosophy
- Updates config example to show all 4 MCP servers

## Constraints

- **Keep existing structure** - Don't redesign, just update outdated info
- **Maintain tone** - Same conversational, learning-focused voice
- **Link to patterns** - Don't duplicate pattern docs, link to `.claude/patterns/README.md`
- **Preserve philosophy** - "Ask → Build → Understand → Improve → Create"
- **Don't remove** - Only add/update, don't delete working sections

## Context Needed

- Current MCP config at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Pattern library index at `.claude/patterns/README.md`
- Context refactor results: CLAUDE.md (107 lines), patterns (120-150), commands (200-320)
- Archon workflow pattern at `.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md`
- Recent git history showing context refactor PRPs
