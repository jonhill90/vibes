# Known Gotchas: Fix Task Manager System

## Overview

This document identifies critical issues, common mistakes, and pitfalls for the task manager Docker Compose setup that has "never worked." Based on analysis of similar systems (Archon, LiteLLM, Supabase), official documentation, and community troubleshooting, the most likely issues fall into three categories: **environment configuration** (90% probability), **database initialization** (70% probability), and **service networking** (60% probability). Every gotcha includes detection methods and actionable solutions.

## Critical Gotchas

### 1. Missing .env File
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Environment Configuration
**Affects**: All services (db, backend, frontend)
**Source**: Docker Compose best practices, community patterns
**Probability**: 90% (most common cause of "never worked")

**What it is**:
Docker Compose tries to load environment variables from `.env` file, but if the file doesn't exist (only `.env.example` is committed to git), all environment-dependent services fail to start or use incorrect default values.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Database credentials undefined or incorrect
- Connection strings malformed (missing user/password/host)
- Services can't communicate (wrong hostnames)
- Ports may conflict if defaults are already in use
- Cryptic errors like "connection refused" or "authentication failed"

**How to detect it**:
- Check if file exists: `ls -la /Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/task-manager/.env`
- If missing, you'll see errors in `docker-compose up` logs mentioning undefined variables
- Services will fail health checks immediately
- Logs show: "FATAL: password authentication failed" or "connection to server at 'db' failed"

**How to avoid/fix**:
```bash
# ✅ RIGHT - Create .env from template FIRST
cd /Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/task-manager
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env if needed (defaults are usually fine for development)
# Then start services
docker-compose up

# ❌ WRONG - Starting without .env file
docker-compose up  # Will fail or use wrong defaults
```

**Explanation**:
Docker Compose uses `.env` file for variable substitution in `docker-compose.yml`. The pattern `${VAR:-default}` provides fallback values, but sensitive values like passwords should be in `.env`, not hardcoded. The `.env.example` file is a template that must be copied to `.env` (which is gitignored).

### 2. PostgreSQL Init Scripts Not Running (Stale Volume)
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Database Initialization
**Affects**: Database service
**Source**: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres (official Docker postgres image docs)
**Probability**: 70% (second most common issue)

**What it is**:
PostgreSQL initialization scripts in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` only run when the data directory is **completely empty**. If a Docker volume already exists from a previous failed run, the database starts with old/incomplete schema and init scripts are silently skipped.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Backend expects tables (projects, tasks) that don't exist
- Queries fail with "relation does not exist" errors
- Database appears healthy but schema is missing
- No error messages indicate why init scripts didn't run
- Developer assumes database is correctly initialized

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check if init script ran
docker-compose logs db | grep "init.sql"

# If no output, script didn't run. Check database directly:
docker exec -it taskmanager-db psql -U taskuser -d taskmanager -c "\dt"

# If you see "Did not find any relations", tables weren't created
# Check for existing volume:
docker volume ls | grep taskmanager
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Restarting without clearing volume
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
# Init script WON'T run because volume still exists

# ✅ RIGHT - Force re-initialization by removing volumes
docker-compose down -v  # -v flag removes volumes
docker-compose up

# Verify init script ran:
docker-compose logs db | grep "init"
docker exec -it taskmanager-db psql -U taskuser -d taskmanager -c "\dt"
# Should see: projects, tasks tables
```

**Alternative solution** (if you need to keep other data):
```bash
# Remove specific volume only
docker volume rm taskmanager-db-data
docker-compose up
```

**Testing for this issue**:
```bash
# After services start, check if tables exist
docker exec taskmanager-db psql -U taskuser -d taskmanager <<EOF
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
EOF

# Should output: projects, tasks
# If empty: volume needs to be cleared
```

### 3. Backend Uses localhost Instead of Service Name
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Docker Networking
**Affects**: Backend service
**Source**: Docker Compose networking documentation
**Probability**: 60%

**What it is**:
Inside a Docker container, `localhost` refers to the container itself, not the host machine or other containers. When backend tries to connect to database at `localhost:5432`, it looks inside its own container and finds nothing.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Backend can't connect to database
- Error: "Connection refused" on localhost:5432
- asyncpg fails with: `asyncpg.exceptions.CannotConnectNowError`
- Developer sees database is running (docker-compose ps shows healthy) but backend can't reach it

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check backend logs for connection errors
docker-compose logs backend | grep -i "connection"

# Common error messages:
# "Connection refused"
# "could not connect to server"
# "[Errno 111] Connection refused"

# Check environment variable in backend container
docker-compose exec backend env | grep DATABASE_URL
# If you see localhost, that's the problem
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Using localhost in Docker network
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://taskuser:taskpass123@localhost:5432/taskmanager"
# This looks for postgres INSIDE the backend container (won't find it)

# ✅ RIGHT - Using Docker Compose service name
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://taskuser:taskpass123@db:5432/taskmanager"
# 'db' is the service name from docker-compose.yml
# Docker's internal DNS resolves 'db' to the database container's IP
```

**In .env file**:
```bash
# ✅ RIGHT
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://taskuser:taskpass123@db:5432/taskmanager

# Note the hostname: 'db' matches the service name in docker-compose.yml:
# services:
#   db:
#     image: postgres:16
```

**How Docker networking works**:
- Docker Compose creates a custom bridge network: `taskmanager-network`
- Each service gets an internal DNS entry matching its service name
- Backend container can reach database via service name: `db`
- Host machine (your laptop) reaches services via `localhost:PORT` (mapped ports)
- Inside containers: use service names (db, backend, frontend)
- Outside containers: use localhost with mapped ports

**Testing connectivity**:
```bash
# From host machine (uses mapped port)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U taskuser -d taskmanager

# From inside backend container (uses service name and internal port)
docker-compose exec backend sh -c 'psql -h db -p 5432 -U taskuser -d taskmanager'
```

## High Priority Gotchas

### 1. Backend Starts Before Database Ready
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Service Startup Order
**Affects**: Backend service
**Source**: https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/startup-order/

**What it is**:
Even with `depends_on: db`, backend may start while database is still initializing. The default `depends_on` only waits for the database *container* to start, not for PostgreSQL to be ready to accept connections.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Backend tries to create connection pool before database is ready
- asyncpg raises connection refused errors
- Backend crashes or goes into error state
- Even with restart policy, timing issues can persist

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check if depends_on uses condition
grep -A 3 "depends_on:" infra/task-manager/docker-compose.yml

# Bad: No condition specified
# depends_on:
#   - db

# Good: Waits for health check
# depends_on:
#   db:
#     condition: service_healthy
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Only waits for container to start
services:
  backend:
    depends_on:
      - db  # Container starts, but PostgreSQL may not be ready

# ✅ RIGHT - Waits for health check to pass
services:
  backend:
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy  # Waits until database is actually ready

  db:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-taskuser} -d ${POSTGRES_DB:-taskmanager}"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s  # Give database time to initialize before checks begin
```

**Why this works better**:
- `service_healthy` condition waits for health check to pass
- `pg_isready` is PostgreSQL's official readiness check
- `start_period: 10s` gives database time to start before health checks count as failures
- Backend only starts after database is confirmed ready

**Example from codebase**:
The task manager's docker-compose.yml already has health checks defined but may need the `condition: service_healthy` added to backend's `depends_on`.

### 2. Vite Server Not Accessible from Host
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Frontend Configuration
**Affects**: Frontend service
**Source**: https://vite.dev/config/server-options

**What it is**:
Vite dev server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) by default, which means it only accepts connections from within the container. When you try to access `http://localhost:3000` from your browser, the connection is refused even though the container is running.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Browser shows "connection refused" or "site can't be reached"
- `curl http://localhost:3000` from host fails
- Port is exposed but server isn't listening on accessible interface
- Developer thinks container is broken when it's just a binding issue

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check frontend logs
docker-compose logs frontend

# Look for Vite startup message
# Bad: "Local: http://127.0.0.1:3000/" (only accessible inside container)
# Good: "Network: http://172.x.x.x:3000/" (accessible from outside)

# Test from host
curl http://localhost:3000
# If connection refused, Vite isn't using --host flag
```

**How to handle it**:
```dockerfile
# ❌ WRONG - Default Vite command (binds to localhost only)
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

# ✅ RIGHT - Vite with --host flag (binds to 0.0.0.0)
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host"]
```

**In vite.config.ts**:
```typescript
// Alternative: Configure in vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: true,  // or '0.0.0.0' - listen on all addresses
    port: 3000,
    strictPort: true,
    watch: {
      usePolling: true,  // Required for Docker on some systems
    },
  },
})
```

**Workaround**:
If Dockerfile can't be changed, override in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
frontend:
  build: ./frontend
  command: npm run dev -- --host
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
```

**Why the fix works**:
- `--host` flag or `host: true` makes Vite bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`
- `0.0.0.0` means "all network interfaces," allowing external connections
- Docker's port mapping (`-p 3000:3000`) can now forward traffic to the server
- `usePolling: true` ensures file watching works in Docker (some filesystems require polling)

### 3. Shell Script Permission Denied (start.sh)
**Severity**: High
**Category**: File Permissions
**Affects**: Backend service
**Source**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38882654/docker-entrypoint-running-bash-script-gets-permission-denied

**What it is**:
The `backend/start.sh` script that launches both MCP server and FastAPI doesn't have execute permissions, causing Docker to fail with "permission denied" error when trying to run it.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Backend container exits immediately on startup
- Error message: `exec /app/start.sh: permission denied`
- Common when files are moved/copied without preserving permissions
- Git may not preserve execute bit depending on configuration

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -l /Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/task-manager/backend/start.sh

# If output shows: -rw-r--r-- (no 'x'), file is not executable
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x (has 'x' for execute)

# Check container logs
docker-compose logs backend
# Look for: "permission denied" or "exec format error"
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```bash
# Option 1: Fix permissions on host before building
chmod +x /Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/task-manager/backend/start.sh
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
docker-compose up

# Option 2: Add chmod in Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
# In backend/Dockerfile

# ❌ WRONG - Copy without ensuring permissions
COPY start.sh /app/start.sh
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]

# ✅ RIGHT - Modern Docker with --chmod flag
COPY --chmod=0755 start.sh /app/start.sh
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]

# ✅ RIGHT - Alternative: RUN chmod after COPY
COPY start.sh /app/start.sh
RUN chmod +x /app/start.sh
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]

# ✅ RIGHT - Use bash explicitly
COPY start.sh /app/start.sh
CMD ["bash", "/app/start.sh"]
```

**Explanation of solutions**:
- **Option 1** (chmod on host): Permissions preserved during COPY, works on Linux/macOS
- **Option 2** (--chmod flag): Requires Docker BuildKit (enabled by default in modern Docker)
- **Option 3** (RUN chmod): Works on all Docker versions, adds a layer
- **Option 4** (bash explicitly): Doesn't require execute bit, bash interprets the script

**Testing the fix**:
```bash
# After rebuild, check if container stays running
docker-compose up -d backend
sleep 5
docker-compose ps backend
# Should show "Up" status, not "Exit 126" or "Restarting"

# Check both processes are running
docker-compose exec backend ps aux
# Should see both: python -m src.mcp_server AND uvicorn
```

### 4. Port Conflicts on Host Machine
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Environment Configuration
**Affects**: All services
**Source**: Common Docker troubleshooting pattern

**What it is**:
Ports 3000, 8000, 8051, or 5432 are already in use by other applications on the host machine, preventing Docker from binding to them.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Docker Compose fails to start with "port is already allocated" error
- Services appear to start but aren't accessible on expected ports
- Confusing if another project uses same default ports

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check for port conflicts before starting
lsof -i :3000 -i :8000 -i :8051 -i :5432

# If output shows processes, ports are in use
# Example output:
# COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
# node      1234  jon    23u  IPv4   0x...      0t0  TCP *:3000 (LISTEN)

# Or use netstat
netstat -an | grep -E ':(3000|8000|8051|5432)'
```

**How to avoid/fix**:
```bash
# Option 1: Stop conflicting services
kill 1234  # PID from lsof output
# Or stop the service: brew services stop postgresql (if using Homebrew)

# Option 2: Change ports in .env file
# Edit .env:
FRONTEND_PORT=3001  # Instead of 3000
API_PORT=8001       # Instead of 8000
MCP_PORT=8052       # Instead of 8051
POSTGRES_PORT=5433  # Instead of 5432

# Then in docker-compose.yml, use:
# ports:
#   - "${FRONTEND_PORT:-3000}:3000"
```

**Prevention strategy**:
```bash
# Create a pre-startup check script
#!/bin/bash
# check-ports.sh

PORTS=(3000 8000 8051 5432)
CONFLICTS=()

for PORT in "${PORTS[@]}"; do
  if lsof -Pi :$PORT -sTCP:LISTEN -t >/dev/null ; then
    CONFLICTS+=($PORT)
  fi
done

if [ ${#CONFLICTS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Port conflicts detected: ${CONFLICTS[*]}"
  echo "Run: lsof -i :<port> to see what's using them"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ All ports available"
fi
```

### 5. CORS Blocks Frontend Requests
**Severity**: High
**Category**: API Security Configuration
**Affects**: Backend + Frontend communication
**Source**: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/

**What it is**:
FastAPI backend doesn't allow requests from frontend origin (`http://localhost:3000`), causing browser to block API responses with CORS errors.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Request reaches backend successfully (shows in backend logs)
- Backend processes request and sends response
- Browser blocks response before JavaScript receives it
- Developer sees "blocked by CORS policy" in browser console
- Backend shows 200 OK, frontend sees error

**How to detect it**:
```javascript
// Open browser console at http://localhost:3000
// Look for error message:
// "Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/tasks' from origin
//  'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy:
//  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present"

// Or check Network tab:
// - Request shows (failed) with CORS error
// - Backend logs show 200 OK response
```

**How to handle it**:
```python
# In backend/src/main.py

# ❌ WRONG - No CORS middleware
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

# Requests from http://localhost:3000 will be blocked

# ✅ RIGHT - CORS middleware with development origins
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

# Allow requests from frontend
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",  # Vite dev server
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000",  # Alternative localhost
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies/auth headers
    allow_methods=["*"],     # Allow all HTTP methods
    allow_headers=["*"],     # Allow all headers
)

# For production, use specific origins:
# allow_origins=["https://yourdomain.com"]
```

**Environment-aware CORS**:
```python
import os
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Use environment variable for flexibility
ENVIRONMENT = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")

if ENVIRONMENT == "development":
    origins = [
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://localhost:8080",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    ]
else:
    # Production: specific domains only
    origins = os.getenv("CORS_ORIGINS", "").split(",")

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Security notes**:
- Never use `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True` (security violation)
- Wildcard `["*"]` doesn't work with credentials (cookies, auth headers)
- CORS headers only added to successful responses (500 errors won't have CORS headers)
- Preflight requests (OPTIONS) must also be allowed

**Testing CORS**:
```bash
# From command line (bypasses CORS - for testing backend only)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/tasks

# From browser console (subject to CORS)
fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/tasks')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
// If CORS is broken, this will fail
```

## Medium Priority Gotchas

### 1. Health Check Timing Too Aggressive
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Docker Compose Configuration
**Affects**: All services with health checks
**Source**: https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#healthcheck

**What it is**:
Health checks without `start_period` begin immediately when container starts, marking service unhealthy before it has time to initialize. This can cause dependent services to never start or restart loops.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Service is actually starting correctly but marked unhealthy
- Logs show service is working, but `docker-compose ps` shows "unhealthy"
- Backend might restart repeatedly due to health check failures during initialization

**How to handle it**:
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - No start_period, health checks begin immediately
db:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U taskuser"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
    # Missing start_period!

# ✅ RIGHT - Generous start_period allows initialization
db:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U taskuser"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 10s  # Give database 10s to initialize before checks count

backend:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
    start_period: 40s  # Backend needs more time (load Python, connect to db)
```

**Recommended timings** (from Archon reference):
- **Database**: `start_period: 10s` (PostgreSQL starts quickly)
- **Backend**: `start_period: 40s` (Python import + DB connection + FastAPI startup)
- **Frontend**: `start_period: 20s` (npm install in dev mode + Vite startup)

**Explanation of timing parameters**:
- `interval`: How often to run health check (after start_period)
- `timeout`: Max time for health check command to complete
- `retries`: Consecutive failures before marking unhealthy
- `start_period`: Grace period where failures don't count (allows initialization)

---

### 2. uv Dependency Installation Fails
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Build Process
**Affects**: Backend service
**Source**: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

**What it is**:
The backend Dockerfile uses `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`, but this syntax is incorrect or dependencies are incompatible, causing build failures.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Build fails with "No solution found when resolving dependencies"
- uv error messages are different from pip
- pyproject.toml may be missing required fields

**How to handle it**:
```dockerfile
# ❌ WRONG - Incorrect uv syntax
RUN uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
# pyproject.toml is not a requirements file!

# ✅ RIGHT - Use uv sync with pyproject.toml
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Install uv
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/uv

# Copy dependency files
COPY pyproject.toml ./
# Copy uv.lock if it exists
COPY uv.lock* ./

# Install dependencies
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-cache

# Alternative: Create venv and install
RUN uv venv /venv && \
    . /venv/bin/activate && \
    uv pip install -e .
```

**Ensure pyproject.toml has required fields**:
```toml
# Must have [project] table
[project]
name = "task-manager-backend"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.104.0",
    "uvicorn>=0.24.0",
    "asyncpg>=0.29.0",
    "fastmcp>=0.4.0",
]

# Optional: dev dependencies
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "pytest>=7.4.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
]
```

**Workaround if uv fails**:
```dockerfile
# Fallback to pip if uv has issues
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir fastapi uvicorn asyncpg fastmcp
```

### 3. asyncpg Connection Pool Errors
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Database Connection
**Affects**: Backend service
**Source**: https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/

**What it is**:
Connection pool fails to initialize due to wrong DSN format, SSL requirements, or pool configuration issues.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Error: "asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidCatalogNameError: database does not exist"
- Or: "asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidPasswordError"
- Connection string format differs from SQLAlchemy

**How to handle it**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - SQLAlchemy format with asyncpg
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db:5432/dbname"
# The +asyncpg is SQLAlchemy syntax, pure asyncpg doesn't use it

# ✅ RIGHT - Pure asyncpg format
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/dbname"

# Or use keyword arguments
import asyncpg

pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    host="db",
    port=5432,
    user="taskuser",
    password="taskpass123",
    database="taskmanager",
    min_size=10,
    max_size=20,
    command_timeout=60.0,
)
```

**Common asyncpg gotchas**:
- Pool must be created ONCE at startup (in FastAPI lifespan)
- Pool is NOT thread-safe (don't share across threads)
- Always close pool on shutdown to avoid resource leaks
- Use `async with pool.acquire() as conn:` to get connections
- Don't create pools per request (massive overhead)

**Best practice pattern**:
```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
import asyncpg

db_pool = None

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    global db_pool
    # Startup
    db_pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
        dsn="postgresql://taskuser:taskpass123@db:5432/taskmanager",
        min_size=10,
        max_size=20,
    )
    print("✅ Database pool created")
    yield
    # Shutdown
    await db_pool.close()
    print("✅ Database pool closed")

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

### 4. Frontend Environment Variables Not Loaded
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Frontend Configuration
**Affects**: Frontend service
**Source**: https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html

**What it is**:
Vite only exposes environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` to client code. Backend API URL defined as `API_URL` instead of `VITE_API_URL` results in undefined value in frontend.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Variable is defined in .env
- Variable is passed to Docker container
- But `import.meta.env.API_URL` is undefined in browser

**How to handle it**:
```bash
# In .env file

# ❌ WRONG - Not prefixed with VITE_
API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# ✅ RIGHT - Prefixed with VITE_
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

```typescript
// In frontend code

// ❌ WRONG - Variable without VITE_ prefix
const API_URL = import.meta.env.API_URL;  // undefined

// ✅ RIGHT - Use VITE_ prefixed variable
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';

// Or use runtime config
const getApiUrl = () => {
  return import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
};
```

**In docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
frontend:
  build: ./frontend
  environment:
    - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Must use VITE_ prefix
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
```

## Low Priority Gotchas

### 1. Docker Build Cache Causes Stale Dependencies
**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Build Process
**Affects**: Backend and Frontend services

**What it is**:
Docker caches layers including dependency installation. If you update `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` but Docker uses cached layer, new dependencies aren't installed.

**How to handle**:
```bash
# Force rebuild without cache
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Or rebuild specific service
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
docker-compose up -d backend
```

---

### 2. React Hot Reload Not Working
**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Development Experience
**Affects**: Frontend service

**What it is**:
File changes don't trigger hot module replacement in Vite when running in Docker.

**How to handle**:
```typescript
// In vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    host: true,
    watch: {
      usePolling: true,  // Required for Docker on some systems
      interval: 100,     // Check every 100ms
    },
  },
})
```

## Library-Specific Quirks

### FastAPI

**Version-Specific Issues**:
- **v0.104.0+**: Lifespan events are the modern way (replaces deprecated `@app.on_event()`)
- **CORS middleware**: Must be added BEFORE routes are registered
- **TestClient**: Doesn't work with async test functions, use `httpx.AsyncClient` instead

**Common Mistakes**:
1. **Forgetting to await async functions**: FastAPI endpoints are async, always await database calls
2. **Using sync functions in async context**: Will block event loop, use `asyncpg` not `psycopg2`
3. **Not handling database connection in lifespan**: Pool must be created at startup, not per request

**Best Practices**:
- Store database pool in `app.state.db_pool` or global variable
- Use dependency injection for database connections
- Always implement health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation

---

### asyncpg

**Connection String Format**:
- Pure asyncpg: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database`
- SQLAlchemy with asyncpg driver: `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:port/database`
- Don't mix the two formats

**Common Mistakes**:
1. **Creating pool per request**: Massive overhead, create ONCE at startup
2. **Not closing pool on shutdown**: Resource leak
3. **Using pool across threads**: Pool is NOT thread-safe

**Best Practices**:
- Create pool in FastAPI lifespan startup
- Use `async with pool.acquire() as conn:` to get connections
- Set reasonable pool size (min_size=10, max_size=20 for small apps)
- Always close pool in lifespan shutdown

---

### Docker Compose

**Version-Specific Issues**:
- **V2+**: No longer requires `version:` field in docker-compose.yml
- **--chmod flag**: Requires Docker BuildKit (enabled by default in modern Docker)
- **Environment variable defaults**: `${VAR:-default}` works in compose.yaml, NOT in .env files

**Common Mistakes**:
1. **Using depends_on without condition**: Only waits for container start, not readiness
2. **No start_period in health checks**: Services marked unhealthy too quickly
3. **Missing .env file**: Variables undefined or wrong defaults used

**Best Practices**:
- Always use `condition: service_healthy` in depends_on
- Generous `start_period` values (10-40s depending on service)
- Provide `.env.example` template
- Use `${VAR:-default}` pattern for all environment variables

---

### Vite

**Version-Specific Issues**:
- **v5.x**: Hot reload may require `usePolling: true` in Docker
- **Environment variables**: Only `VITE_` prefixed variables exposed to client

**Common Mistakes**:
1. **No --host flag**: Server not accessible from outside container
2. **Wrong env var prefix**: Variables without `VITE_` prefix are undefined
3. **Port not exposed**: Dockerfile exposes 3000 but docker-compose maps different port

**Best Practices**:
- Always use `--host` flag or `host: true` in config
- Prefix all client-side env vars with `VITE_`
- Use `usePolling: true` for reliable hot reload in Docker
- Set `strictPort: true` to fail fast if port in use

---

## Performance Gotchas

### 1. Database Connection Pool Saturation
**Impact**: High latency, request timeouts
**Affects**: Backend under load

**The problem**:
```python
# ❌ SLOW - Pool too small, requests queue waiting for connections
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn=DATABASE_URL,
    min_size=2,
    max_size=5,
)
# Under load, requests wait for available connection
```

**The solution**:
```python
# ✅ FAST - Appropriately sized pool
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn=DATABASE_URL,
    min_size=10,   # Always have 10 warm connections
    max_size=20,   # Can scale to 20 under load
    command_timeout=60.0,
)
```

**Rule of thumb**:
- `min_size`: Number of concurrent requests you expect normally
- `max_size`: 2x min_size for burst traffic
- For small apps: min=10, max=20 is fine
- For production: Monitor connection usage and adjust

---

### 2. N+1 Query Problem
**Impact**: High database load, slow responses
**Affects**: API endpoints that load related data

**The problem**:
```python
# ❌ SLOW - N+1 queries
# 1 query to get all tasks
tasks = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM tasks")

# N queries to get project for each task (in loop)
for task in tasks:
    project = await conn.fetchrow(
        "SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = $1",
        task['project_id']
    )
```

**The solution**:
```python
# ✅ FAST - Single query with JOIN
tasks_with_projects = await conn.fetch("""
    SELECT
        t.*,
        p.name as project_name,
        p.description as project_description
    FROM tasks t
    LEFT JOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.id
""")
```

## Security Gotchas

### 1. Exposed Database Port
**Severity**: Medium
**Type**: Security Misconfiguration
**Affects**: Database service

**Vulnerability**:
```yaml
# ❌ VULNERABLE - Database exposed to host
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Anyone on host network can connect
```

**Secure Implementation**:
```yaml
# ✅ SECURE - Database only accessible from Docker network
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    # No ports mapping! Only accessible to backend container
    networks:
      - taskmanager-network

  backend:
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - taskmanager-network  # Can reach db via service name
```

**When to expose database port**:
- Development: OK to expose for debugging with `psql`
- Production: NEVER expose unless behind VPN/firewall

**Security measures applied**:
1. No port mapping = not accessible from host
2. Only services in same network can connect
3. Credentials still required even if exposed

---

### 2. Weak Default Passwords
**Severity**: High
**Type**: Credentials
**Affects**: Database service

**Vulnerability**:
```bash
# ❌ VULNERABLE - Weak default in .env.example
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://taskuser:password123@db:5432/taskmanager
```

**Secure Implementation**:
```bash
# ✅ SECURE - Strong random password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=xK9mP2nQ4wE7vR5tY8uI1oL3zX6cV0bN

# Or generate random password
# openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Best practices**:
- Use strong random passwords (20+ characters)
- Different passwords for dev vs production
- Never commit .env file (only .env.example)
- Rotate passwords periodically in production

---

## Testing Gotchas

### Common Test Pitfalls

**1. Using sync tests with async code**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Sync test can't await
def test_create_task():
    result = create_task()  # SyntaxError: await outside async function

# ✅ RIGHT - Async test with pytest-asyncio
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_task():
    result = await create_task()
    assert result['id'] is not None
```

**2. Not isolating database state**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Tests affect each other
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_task(db_pool):
    task = await create_task(db_pool, "Test task")
    # Task left in database, affects next test

# ✅ RIGHT - Cleanup after test
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_task(db_pool):
    task = await create_task(db_pool, "Test task")
    yield
    # Cleanup
    await db_pool.execute("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = $1", task['id'])
```

---

## Deployment Gotchas

### Environment-Specific Issues

**Development**:
- Hot reload works with volume mounts
- Debug logging enabled
- CORS allows all local origins
- Exposed database ports for debugging

**Staging**:
- No hot reload (built static files)
- Reduced logging
- CORS restricted to staging domain
- No exposed database ports

**Production**:
- Multi-stage builds for minimal images
- Production logging (structured JSON)
- Strict CORS (specific domains only)
- Secrets from environment, not .env files
- Health checks monitored
- Restart policies: `unless-stopped`

**Configuration Issues**:
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Same config for all environments
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=development  # Hardcoded

# ✅ RIGHT - Environment-aware config
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT:-development}
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-false}
```

- [ ] DATABASE_URL uses service name `db`, not `localhost`
- [ ] Frontend env vars prefixed with `VITE_`

**Docker Compose Setup**:
- [ ] Health checks have `start_period` (10s for db, 40s for backend)
- [ ] Backend uses `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`
- [ ] Volume for database data: `taskmanager-db-data`
- [ ] Init script mounted: `./database:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro`

**Service Configuration**:
- [ ] Vite uses `--host` flag or `host: true` in config
- [ ] `start.sh` has execute permissions (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] CORS middleware configured with `http://localhost:3000` origin
- [ ] asyncpg uses correct DSN format (no `+asyncpg` in URL)

**Database**:
- [ ] Init script runs (check logs: `docker-compose logs db | grep init`)
- [ ] Tables exist (`docker exec ... psql -c "\dt"`)
- [ ] Health check uses `pg_isready` with correct user/db

**Testing**:

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

When generating the PRP:

1. **Include critical gotchas** in "Known Gotchas & Library Quirks" section
   - Missing .env file (90% probability)
   - PostgreSQL init scripts (70% probability)
   - localhost vs service name (60% probability)

2. **Reference solutions** in "Implementation Blueprint"
   - Step 1: Copy .env.example to .env
   - Step 2: docker-compose down -v for clean slate
   - Step 3: Verify health checks have start_period
   - Step 4: Check DATABASE_URL uses 'db' not 'localhost'
   - Step 5: Ensure Vite uses --host flag

3. **Add detection tests** to validation gates
   - Check .env exists
   - Verify database tables created
   - Test health endpoints
   - Confirm CORS headers present

4. **Warn about version issues** in documentation references
   - FastAPI: Use lifespan events, not @app.on_event
   - Docker Compose: V2 doesn't need version field
   - asyncpg: Pure format differs from SQLAlchemy format

5. **Highlight anti-patterns** to avoid
   - Don't use localhost in container context
   - Don't restart without clearing volumes
   - Don't skip start_period in health checks
   - Don't forget VITE_ prefix for env vars
