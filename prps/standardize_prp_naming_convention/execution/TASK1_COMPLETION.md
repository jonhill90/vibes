## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Core Rules (7 Rules)
- **Rule 1**: No redundant prefixes (never use `prp_`)
- **Rule 2**: Workflow prefixes are optional and auto-detected (`INITIAL_`, `EXAMPLE_`)
- **Rule 3**: Final PRPs have clean names (remove `INITIAL_` after finalization)
- **Rule 4**: Feature names must use valid characters (alphanumeric + `_` + `-`)
- **Rule 5**: Case sensitivity matters (workflow prefixes MUST be uppercase)
- **Rule 6**: Length limits (50 characters or fewer)
- **Rule 7**: Directory matching (directory name must match feature name)

#### 2. Decision Trees (3 Trees)
- **When Creating a New PRP**: Guide for choosing prefix (INITIAL_ vs clean name)
- **When Naming a Feature**: Step-by-step validation checklist
- **When Stripping Prefixes**: Logic for determining strip_prefix parameter usage

#### 3. Examples Section
- **Correct Naming (10+ examples)**:
  - Simple feature: `prps/user_auth.md`
  - Hyphenated name: `prps/api-gateway.md`
  - Multi-word with version: `prps/task_management_v2.md`
  - Initial PRP: `prps/INITIAL_new_feature.md`
  - Descriptive name: `prps/execution_reliability.md`
  - Example/template: `prps/EXAMPLE_template_structure.md`

- **Incorrect Naming (16+ examples)**:
  - Redundant `prp_` prefix
  - Wrong case for workflow prefix
  - Invalid characters (spaces, special characters)
  - Too long (exceeds 50 characters)
  - Directory doesn't match filename

#### 4. FAQ Section (10 Questions)
- Q1: Why can't I use `prp_` as a prefix?
- Q2: When should I use `INITIAL_` prefix?
- Q3: What if I have an existing PRP with `prp_` prefix?
- Q4: Can I use `strip_prefix="prp_"` to handle legacy files?
- Q5: Are hyphens or underscores preferred?
- Q6: What about Windows reserved names?
- Q7: What if my feature name is naturally very long?
- Q8: Can I have multiple prefixes?
- Q9: How do I know if a PRP is finalized?
- Q10: What happens if I violate these conventions?

#### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- Feature name extraction logic
- Auto-detection mechanism
- Prefix stripping (critical fix: `removeprefix()` vs `replace()`)
- Allowed prefixes whitelist
- 6-level validation structure

#### 6. Migration Guide
- Steps for existing PRPs with violations
- Workflow for new PRPs
- Commands for renaming and updating references

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: replace() vs removeprefix()
**From PRP**: Lines 259-289 (Critical Gotcha 1)

**Implementation**: Documented the critical difference with clear examples:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Replaces ALL occurrences
feature = "INITIAL_INITIAL_test"
feature = feature.replace("INITIAL_", "")  # Returns "test" (both removed!)

# ✅ RIGHT - Only removes leading prefix
feature = "INITIAL_INITIAL_test"
feature = feature.removeprefix("INITIAL_")  # Returns "INITIAL_test" (correct!)
```

**Rationale**: This is the core bug affecting all 27 files in the codebase. The documentation clearly explains WHY `removeprefix()` is correct and includes the exact bug scenario.

#### Gotcha #2: prp_ is NOT a Workflow Prefix
**From PRP**: Lines 38-39, 44-46, FAQ Q4

**Implementation**: Emphasized throughout the document:
- Core Rule 1: "NEVER use `prp_` prefix"
- Decision Tree: "Is this a prp_ prefixed file? YES → STOP! Don't use strip_prefix"
- FAQ Q4: "No. `prp_` is not a valid workflow prefix"
- Technical Implementation: Whitelist only allows `INITIAL_` and `EXAMPLE_`

**Rationale**: This is a conceptual error that needs to be prevented at the convention level.

#### Gotcha #3: Case Sensitivity
**From PRP**: Lines 384-404 (Medium Priority Gotcha 6)

**Implementation**: Core Rule 5 and FAQ examples:
```
✅ CORRECT: INITIAL_user_auth.md
❌ WRONG: initial_user_auth.md
❌ WRONG: Initial_user_auth.md
```

**Rationale**: Lowercase prefixes won't be auto-detected, breaking automation.

#### Gotcha #4: Windows Reserved Names
**From PRP**: Lines 407-425 (Medium Priority Gotcha 7)

**Implementation**: FAQ Q6 with specific examples:
```
❌ Avoid: con.md, prn.md, aux.md, nul.md
✅ Use:   console.md, printer.md, auxiliary.md
```

**Rationale**: Cross-platform compatibility requires avoiding Windows device names.

#### Gotcha #5: Empty Feature Name After Stripping
**From PRP**: Lines 361-381 (High Priority Gotcha 5)

**Implementation**: Not explicitly called out as a gotcha in the convention doc, but handled in the validation logic description in "Technical Implementation" section.

**Rationale**: This is an implementation detail handled by the validation function.

## Additional Notes

### Documentation Structure
The naming convention document follows best practices for technical documentation:

1. **Quick Reference at Top**: Core rules (7 rules) appear early for quick scanning
2. **Decision Trees**: Visual guides for common scenarios (3 trees)
3. **Examples Section**: Separated into correct (GREEN) and incorrect (RED) with visual indicators
4. **FAQ**: Answers 10 common questions developers might have
5. **Technical Details**: Implementation specifics for developers working on validation code
6. **Migration Guide**: Actionable steps for fixing existing violations

### Key Strengths

1. **Rationale-Driven**: Each rule explains WHY, not just WHAT
2. **Visual**: Uses ✅ ❌ ⚠️ for quick scanning
3. **Actionable**: Decision trees guide developers to correct decisions
4. **Comprehensive**: 16+ incorrect examples show common mistakes
5. **Cross-Referenced**: Links to implementation files and related docs
6. **Version Controlled**: Includes changelog for future updates

### Pattern Following

This documentation follows patterns from:
- **error_message_pattern.py**: Actionable 5-part structure (Problem → Rationale → Examples → Resolution)
- **examples/README.md**: Clear section structure with "What to Mimic/Adapt/Skip"
- **security_validation_5level.py**: Layered approach (7 rules, 6 validation levels)

### Next Steps

This documentation is now ready to be referenced by:
1. Task 2-3: Code updates (replace() → removeprefix())
2. Task 4: 6th validation level implementation
3. Task 8: Optional linter script
4. Task 10: Documentation references in CLAUDE.md

**Ready for integration and next steps.**
