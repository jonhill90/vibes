# Task 10 Implementation Complete: Update Documentation References

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: N/A
- **Task Name**: Task 10 - Update Documentation References
- **Responsibility**: Ensure CLAUDE.md and README.md reflect new PRP naming convention
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
None (documentation updates only)

### Modified Files:

1. **/Users/jon/source/vibes/CLAUDE.md**
   - Added: PRP Naming Convention section (lines 98-114)
   - Added: Reference to .claude/conventions/prp-naming.md
   - Added: Quick reference with key rules and examples
   - Added: Visual examples showing correct vs incorrect naming

2. **/Users/jon/source/vibes/README.md**
   - Added: Naming Convention subsection under "What are PRPs?" (lines 139-142)
   - Added: Reference to .claude/conventions/prp-naming.md
   - Added: Key rules summary for quick reference

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. CLAUDE.md Updates
- Added comprehensive "PRP Naming Convention" subsection under "PRP-Driven Development"
- Included direct link to canonical conventions document
- Added quick reference table with key rules:
  - PRP files format
  - Initial PRP prefix handling
  - Directory naming convention
  - Valid character restrictions
  - Explicit prohibition of prp_ prefix
- Added visual examples (correct/incorrect) for immediate clarity

#### 2. README.md Updates
- Integrated naming convention reference into "What are PRPs?" section
- Maintains flow while adding essential information
- Provides quick summary without duplicating full convention doc
- Links to authoritative source for complete rules

#### 3. Documentation Consistency Verification
- Verified no contradictory information about PRP naming
- Legacy references (e.g., prp_context_refactor validation report) left intact
- These are valid historical file references, not contradictions
- Convention document already addresses legacy files

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Avoiding Redundancy
**PRP Concern**: Don't duplicate convention documentation in multiple places
**Implementation**: Used summary + link pattern in both files. Full rules live in single authoritative location (.claude/conventions/prp-naming.md)

#### Gotcha #2: Maintaining Context Flow
**PRP Concern**: Documentation updates shouldn't disrupt reading flow
**Implementation**:
- CLAUDE.md: Added as subsection under existing PRP-Driven Development section
- README.md: Integrated naturally into "What are PRPs?" definition

#### Gotcha #3: Legacy File References
**PRP Concern**: Existing references to prp_context_refactor shouldn't be removed
**Implementation**: Verified that README.md reference is to actual existing file path. Convention doc already explains legacy files are acceptable.

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- Task 1: Naming convention documentation (.claude/conventions/prp-naming.md) exists and is comprehensive
- Task 5-6: Validation integration completed (ensures new PRPs follow conventions)
- All previous tasks completed successfully

### External Dependencies:
None - Documentation updates only

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Verification:

- [x] CLAUDE.md contains PRP Naming Convention section
- [x] CLAUDE.md references .claude/conventions/prp-naming.md
- [x] CLAUDE.md includes quick reference with key rules
- [x] CLAUDE.md includes visual examples (correct/incorrect)
- [x] README.md includes naming convention reference
- [x] README.md links to canonical conventions document
- [x] No contradictory information found in documentation
- [x] Legacy file references (prp_context_refactor) verified as valid
- [x] Markdown links are properly formatted
- [x] Documentation flows naturally without disruption

### Validation Results:

**Documentation Quality**:
- ✅ References are accurate and clickable
- ✅ Quick reference provides immediate value
- ✅ Visual examples enhance understanding
- ✅ Single source of truth established (conventions doc)
- ✅ Summary + link pattern prevents duplication

**Consistency**:
- ✅ No conflicting naming guidance found
- ✅ Legacy references properly contextualized
- ✅ All documentation aligns with new convention

**Completeness**:
- ✅ Both CLAUDE.md and README.md updated
- ✅ All PRP requirements met
- ✅ Cross-references properly established

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:
- [x] CLAUDE.md references .claude/conventions/prp-naming.md
- [x] Quick reference section present in CLAUDE.md
- [x] All existing documentation updated (CLAUDE.md and README.md)
- [x] No contradictory information in docs

**Code Quality**:
- ✅ Clear, concise documentation
- ✅ Proper markdown formatting
- ✅ Logical information hierarchy
- ✅ Maintains existing documentation flow
- ✅ Single source of truth pattern (summary + link)

## Completion Report

**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review
**Implementation Time**: ~10 minutes
**Confidence Level**: HIGH
**Blockers**: None

### Files Created: 0
### Files Modified: 2
- CLAUDE.md (added 17 lines)
- README.md (added 4 lines)

### Total Lines Added: ~21 lines

## Implementation Pattern Used

Followed **Documentation Cross-Reference Pattern**:
1. Create single authoritative source (.claude/conventions/prp-naming.md) ✅ (Task 1)
2. Add summary + link in primary docs ✅ (This task)
3. Include quick reference for immediate value ✅
4. Use examples for clarity ✅

This pattern prevents documentation drift and maintains consistency.

## Notes

- Legacy file references (e.g., prps/prp_context_refactor/execution/validation-report.md) are intentionally left intact
- These are valid historical file paths, not naming convention violations
- The conventions document already explains that existing files may use legacy naming
- Task 9 (retroactive cleanup) is optional and can be done separately

**Ready for validation and integration.**
