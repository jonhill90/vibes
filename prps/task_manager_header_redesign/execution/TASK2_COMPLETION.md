## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Header Row Restructure
- Removed ProjectSelector from header row (previously alongside ThemeToggle)
- ThemeToggle now appears alone in upper right corner
- Maintained "Task Management" title and subtitle on the left
- Updated comment to reflect "Theme Toggle ONLY" on right side

#### 2. Sub-Header Section Redesign
- Removed redundant "Kanban Board" h2 header text completely
- Positioned ProjectSelector in place of removed header
- Maintained task count display below ProjectSelector
- Updated section comment to clarify replacement

#### 3. Layout Hierarchy Improvement
- Created clearer visual hierarchy: Title (row 1) -> Project Selector (row 2) -> Kanban Board
- Improved information architecture by making project selector more prominent
- Eliminated redundant "Kanban Board" text that duplicated context

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Parallel Task Execution Safety
**Implementation**: Only modified KanbanBoard.tsx as specified in task assignment. Did not touch any other files that Task 1 might be modifying (tailwind.config.js).

#### Gotcha #2: Preserving Component Props
**Implementation**: Maintained exact same props structure when moving ProjectSelector:
```tsx
<ProjectSelector
  selectedProjectId={selectedProjectId}
  onProjectChange={onProjectChange}
  onCreateProject={onCreateProject}
/>
```
No props added, removed, or modified - pure repositioning.

#### Gotcha #3: Maintaining Existing Functionality
**Implementation**:
- Preserved all imports (ProjectSelector, ThemeToggle)
- Kept task count logic unchanged: `{tasks?.length || 0} tasks total`
- No changes to component state, hooks, or business logic
- Pure JSX restructuring

#### Gotcha #4: Comment Accuracy
**Implementation**: Updated all comments to reflect new structure:
- Header comment: Removed "Project Selector" from description
- Right-side comment: Changed to "Theme Toggle ONLY"
- Sub-header comment: Changed to "Project Selector Section (replaces 'Kanban Board' header)"

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 1 (Tailwind Dark Mode Configuration)**: Running in parallel - no dependency conflicts
  - Task 1 modifies: `tailwind.config.js`
  - Task 2 modifies: `KanbanBoard.tsx`
  - No file conflicts - safe for parallel execution

### External Dependencies:
- **React**: Component rendering (already in project)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling classes (already in project)
- **ProjectSelector component**: Already exists and imported
- **ThemeToggle component**: Already exists and imported

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When App is Running):
- [ ] Navigate to task manager page
- [ ] Verify "Task Management" title appears on left side
- [ ] Verify subtitle "Organize your tasks with drag-and-drop Kanban board" appears below title
- [ ] Verify ThemeToggle button appears alone on right side (same row as title)
- [ ] Verify NO ProjectSelector in header row
- [ ] Verify ProjectSelector dropdown appears in sub-header (below title)
- [ ] Verify task count appears below ProjectSelector
- [ ] Verify NO "Kanban Board" text anywhere in header
- [ ] Test ProjectSelector dropdown opens and functions correctly
- [ ] Test ThemeToggle still works independently
- [ ] Verify no layout shift or visual glitches

### Validation Results:
**Code Validation**:
- Component structure valid (TSX syntax correct)
- All imports remain intact (ProjectSelector, ThemeToggle)
- Props structure preserved exactly as before
- Comments updated to match new structure
- No syntax errors introduced

**Layout Validation** (Visual Check Required):
- Header row: Title (left) + ThemeToggle (right) ✓
- Sub-header row: ProjectSelector + task count ✓
- "Kanban Board" text removed ✓
- ProjectSelector moved from header to sub-header ✓

**Functional Validation** (Runtime Testing Required):
- Component renders without errors (syntax validated)
- ProjectSelector props unchanged (functionality preserved)
- ThemeToggle positioning maintained (functionality preserved)
- Task count display logic unchanged

## Success Metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Task 1 Completion**: Wait for Task 1 (Tailwind darkMode config) to complete
2. **Dev Server Restart**: After Task 1, restart dev server to load new Tailwind config
3. **Visual Validation**: Test layout in browser:
   - Verify header structure matches mockup
   - Test ProjectSelector functionality
   - Test ThemeToggle functionality
   - Verify no layout shift or visual bugs
4. **Task 3 Execution**: Proceed to Task 3 (Test Theme Toggle Functionality)
5. **Task 4 Execution**: Proceed to Task 4 (Test Layout Changes)

## Implementation Notes

**Pattern Followed**: example_4_header_layout_pattern.tsx
- Studied the before/after pattern from examples directory
- Implemented exact changes specified in pattern
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Updated comments to match new structure

**Design Decisions**:
1. **Kept gap-4 in right-side div**: Even though only ThemeToggle remains, kept the flex container structure for consistency and potential future additions
2. **Updated all comments**: Changed comments proactively to reflect new reality (not just code changes)
3. **Preserved exact props**: Did not modify ProjectSelector props to ensure zero functional changes
4. **Maintained spacing**: Kept mb-6 classes and layout spacing identical to before

**Quality Assurance**:
- No new dependencies added
- No breaking changes to component API
- All TypeScript types remain valid
- Code follows existing codebase patterns
- Comments are accurate and helpful
