## Files Created

### 1. git_mv_operations.sh (290 lines)
**Purpose**: Safe directory consolidation and file renaming with git history preservation

**Key Functions**:
- `move_directory_contents()` - Move directories with pre-flight checks
- `rename_file_with_git()` - Rename files preserving git history
- `delete_empty_directory()` - Safely delete only truly empty directories
- `rollback_git_operations()` - Undo file operations if something goes wrong
- `validate_consolidation()` - Verify directory consolidation completed

**What to Mimic**:
- Pre-flight checks (source exists, destination doesn't, parent exists)
- Always use `git mv` not shell `mv` to preserve history
- Verify directories are empty before deleting (use `find`, not `ls`)
- Provide rollback capability for failed operations
- Return clear error codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)

**Relevance**: 10/10 - Core pattern for Task 1 (directory consolidation) and Task 2 (PRP file rename)

---

### 2. multi_file_find_replace.py (370 lines)
**Purpose**: Safe multi-file text replacement with validation and backup

**Key Functions**:
- `find_replace_in_file()` - Replace text in single file with safety checks
- `find_replace_in_files()` - Batch process multiple files
- `update_file_paths()` - Special handling for file path variations
- `validate_no_old_references()` - Verify old text completely removed
- `backup_files()` / `restore_from_backups()` - Backup/restore mechanism

**What to Mimic**:
- Dry run first (preview changes), then confirm, then execute
- Create backups before modification, restore on error
- Validate after replacement (ensure 0 old references remain)
- Handle file paths specially (with/without trailing slash, markdown links)
- Provide detailed preview with line numbers and counts

**Relevance**: 10/10 - Core pattern for Task 3 (documentation updates)

---

### 3. validation_checks.sh (290 lines)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation suite for file operations

**Key Functions**:
- `validate_file_exists()` / `validate_file_not_exists()` - Check files present/absent
- `validate_directory_structure()` - Verify expected directory layout
- `validate_no_old_references()` - Grep for old text in files
- `validate_markdown_file_paths()` - Check all referenced paths are valid
- `run_comprehensive_validation()` - Execute all validations with summary

**What to Mimic**:
- Validate both positive (files exist) and negative (old files removed)
- Use grep to find old references recursively
- Extract and check file paths from markdown documentation
- Run all validations even if some fail (don't exit early)
- Provide summary statistics (X/Y passed, percentage)

**Relevance**: 10/10 - Critical for Task 6 (validation requirements)

---

### 4. directory_tree_visualization.py (260 lines)
**Purpose**: Generate before/after directory tree visualizations

**Key Functions**:
- `generate_tree()` - Create tree-style directory visualization
- `compare_directory_structures()` - Side-by-side before/after comparison
- `get_directory_stats()` - Calculate statistics (file count, size, types)
- `generate_markdown_tree()` - Create markdown documentation
- `document_execution_reliability_cleanup()` - Example usage

**What to Mimic**:
- Generate tree output similar to `tree` command (├──, └──, │)
- Show before/after comparison for documentation
- Calculate statistics (file count, total size, largest files)
- Generate markdown documentation automatically
- Limit depth to 3-4 levels for readability

**Relevance**: 9/10 - Useful for documenting changes in completion reports

---

**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide explaining all examples

**Contents**:
- Overview of all 4 examples with relevance scores
- "What to Mimic/Adapt/Skip" sections for each example
- Pattern highlights with code snippets
- Usage instructions for each example
- Common patterns across examples
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Integration with PRP guidance
- Source attribution

**Relevance**: 10/10 - Essential reference for implementer

---

## Key Patterns Extracted

### Pattern 1: Pre-flight Checks (Example 1)
```bash
# Before every file operation:
# 1. Check source exists
# 2. Check destination doesn't exist (avoid overwrite)
# 3. Check parent directory exists
# Then proceed with operation
```

**Why**: Prevents data loss, provides clear error messages, catches issues early

---

### Pattern 2: Git History Preservation (Example 1)
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Preserves history
git mv source destination

# ❌ WRONG: Loses history
mv source destination
git add destination
git rm source
```

**Why**: Git history is invaluable for debugging. `git blame` and `git log --follow` work correctly.

---

### Pattern 3: Dry Run → Confirm → Execute (Example 2)
```python
# 1. Dry run (preview changes)
results = find_replace_in_files(files, old, new, dry_run=True)
print_preview(results)

# 2. User confirmation
if not confirm("Proceed?"):
    exit(0)

# 3. Execute actual changes
find_replace_in_files(files, old, new, dry_run=False)
```

**Why**: Humans catch edge cases that scripts miss. Prevents accidental bulk changes.

---

### Pattern 4: Backup Before Modification (Example 2)
```python
# Create backups
backups = backup_files(files, suffix=".bak")

try:
    # Modify files
    find_replace_in_files(files, old, new, dry_run=False)

    # Validate
    if validate_success():
        delete_backups(backups)  # Success
    else:
        restore_from_backups(backups)  # Validation failed

except Exception as e:
    restore_from_backups(backups)  # Error occurred
    raise
```

**Why**: Insurance against data loss. Automatic restore on failure.

---

### Pattern 5: Comprehensive Validation (Example 3)
```bash
# Validate positive conditions
validate_file_exists "new_file.md"

# Validate negative conditions
validate_file_not_exists "old_file.md"

# Validate references updated
validate_no_old_references "directory" "old_text"

# Validate file paths
validate_markdown_file_paths "document.md"

# Summary
echo "Passed: ${passed}/${total} (${percentage}%)"
```

**Why**: Catches partial operations, broken references, missing files. Provides confidence.

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

### 1. Reference Examples in "All Needed Context"
```markdown
## Code Examples

See `prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/README.md` for comprehensive guide.

Key examples:
- **git_mv_operations.sh**: Directory consolidation patterns (Tasks 1-2)
- **multi_file_find_replace.py**: Documentation update patterns (Task 3)
- **validation_checks.sh**: Validation patterns (Task 6)
- **directory_tree_visualization.py**: Before/after documentation (all tasks)
```

### 2. Include Pattern Highlights in "Implementation Blueprint"
```markdown
## Phase 1: Directory Consolidation

**Pattern to use**: See `examples/git_mv_operations.sh` - Functions:
- `move_directory_contents()` for moving examples/, planning/
- `rename_file_with_git()` for PRP file rename
- `delete_empty_directory()` for cleanup

**Key safety checks**:
1. Pre-flight: Source exists, destination doesn't
2. Use git mv (not shell mv)
3. Verify empty before deleting
4. Rollback capability if errors
```

### 3. Direct Implementer to Study Examples First
```markdown
## Before Implementation

**CRITICAL**: Study examples before coding (45-60 minutes):

1. Read `examples/README.md` - Comprehensive guide
2. Review `git_mv_operations.sh` - Directory consolidation patterns
3. Review `multi_file_find_replace.py` - Text replacement patterns
4. Review `validation_checks.sh` - Validation patterns
5. Review `directory_tree_visualization.py` - Documentation patterns

**Key patterns to mimic**:
- Pre-flight checks before operations
- Git history preservation (git mv)
- Dry run → confirm → execute
- Backup before modification
- Comprehensive validation
```

### 4. Use Examples for Validation
```markdown
## Validation Checklist

After implementation, verify code follows example patterns:

- ✅ Used `git mv` not shell `mv` (Example 1)
- ✅ Pre-flight checks before operations (Example 1)
- ✅ Dry run before bulk text replacement (Example 2)
- ✅ Backups created before modification (Example 2)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation suite (Example 3)
- ✅ Both positive and negative validation (Example 3)
- ✅ Before/after documentation (Example 4)
```

## Search Strategy

### Archon Code Search (Performed First)
**Queries**:
1. "bash git mv directory" - 5 results, none relevant (MCP server logging, hooks)
2. "find replace files script" - 0 results
3. "validation grep pattern" - 5 results, none relevant (MCP server setup, error handling)

**Conclusion**: No directly applicable file operation scripts in Archon. This is a **novel cleanup pattern** specific to this codebase.

### Local Codebase Search
**Queries**:
1. `grep "git mv"` - Found 2 files (feature analysis, naming convention INITIAL)
2. `grep "Path.*exists"` - Found 7 Python files with pathlib patterns
3. `glob "**/*.sh"` - Found 17 shell scripts (setup, test, infrastructure)

**Key Findings**:
- **prp_context_refactor/examples/**: Similar cleanup examples (README compression, pattern extraction)
- **execution_reliability/examples/validation_gate_pattern.py**: Validation patterns (EAFP, error messages)
- **test_validation_gates_script.py**: Test-driven validation, actionable error messages

**Extraction Strategy**:
- Read prp_context_refactor README for inspiration on structure
- Extract validation patterns from execution_reliability
- Create new bash/Python scripts for file operations (no existing scripts found)
- Use git best practices and pathlib documentation for safe operations

---

## Novel Patterns Created

Since no existing file operation scripts were found, created these **novel patterns**:

1. **git_mv_operations.sh**: Comprehensive bash script for directory consolidation
   - Combined git best practices with pre-flight checks
   - Added rollback capability for failed operations
   - Included validation functions for verification

2. **multi_file_find_replace.py**: Safe multi-file text replacement
   - Dry run → confirm → backup → execute → validate workflow
   - Special handling for file path variations
   - Automatic backup/restore on error

3. **validation_checks.sh**: Comprehensive validation suite
   - Both positive (exists) and negative (not exists) validation
   - Grep-based reference checking
   - Markdown file path validation
   - Summary statistics (X/Y passed, percentage)

4. **directory_tree_visualization.py**: Before/after documentation
   - Tree-style visualization (like `tree` command)
   - Directory statistics (file count, size, types)
   - Markdown output for documentation

These patterns are **reusable** for future cleanup PRPs.
