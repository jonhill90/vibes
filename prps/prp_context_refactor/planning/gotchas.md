# Known Gotchas: PRP Context Refactor

## Overview

This refactor targets 59% context reduction (1,044→430 lines) through CLAUDE.md deduplication, pattern compression, and security function extraction. Primary risks include **over-compression breaking clarity** (removing necessary context), **validation regression** (breaking 95.8% pass rate), and **reference fragility** (cross-file dependencies). All gotchas include detection methods and concrete solutions to maintain functionality while achieving compression targets.

---

## Critical Gotchas

### 1. Context Rot from Over-Compression (Clarity Loss)

**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Documentation Quality / Usability
**Affects**: Pattern files (373-387 lines → 120 lines target)
**Source**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents

**What it is**:
Aggressively removing commentary and examples to hit 120-line targets, resulting in patterns that are too terse to understand or use effectively. The goal is "reference card" style (80% code / 20% commentary), but removing too much context creates unusable abstractions.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Patterns become cryptic without enough explanation
- Copy-paste fails because critical context is missing
- Developers waste time reverse-engineering what the pattern does
- Defeats progressive disclosure purpose (patterns should clarify, not obscure)

**How to detect it**:
- Read compressed pattern cold (no prior context) - can you use it?
- Check if code snippets are standalone (can they be copy-pasted?)
- Verify critical warnings preserved (security, anti-patterns, gotchas)
- Test: Give pattern to someone unfamiliar - can they apply it?

**How to avoid/fix**:

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Over-compressed (lost critical context)
## Archon Health Check
```python
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
```

# ✅ RIGHT - Optimal compression (preserves essential context)
## Archon Health Check (ALWAYS FIRST)

```python
# Check Archon availability before using features
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

if not archon_available:
    # Graceful degradation - continue without Archon tracking
    project_id = None
    print("ℹ️ Archon unavailable - proceeding without project tracking")
```

**Why first?** Prevents workflow failures if Archon unavailable.
**Returns**: `{"status": "healthy"}` or raises exception.
```

**Compression checklist**:
- ✅ Keep ALL security warnings (non-negotiable)
- ✅ Preserve copy-paste ready code snippets
- ✅ Include minimal "why" context (1-2 sentences)
- ✅ Retain critical anti-patterns
- ✅ Keep return value / error descriptions
- ❌ Remove verbose explanations
- ❌ Cut duplicate examples (keep best one)
- ❌ Eliminate tutorial-style prose

**Quality gate**: Can a developer use this pattern without reading the original 373-line version?

---

### 2. Validation Regression (Breaking 95.8% Pass Rate)

**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Functionality Preservation
**Affects**: All 5 security checks, scoped directory creation, parallel execution
**Source**: prps/prp_context_cleanup/execution/validation-report.md

**What it is**:
Refactoring commands or patterns in a way that breaks existing functionality. Current system passes 23/24 validation criteria (95.8%). Any regression below this threshold is unacceptable.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Security vulnerabilities (5 checks: whitelist, traversal, injection, length, directory traversal)
- Functionality breaks (parallel execution, Archon integration, scoped directories)
- Context pollution returns (global directories, pattern loading)
- Defeats entire purpose of refactoring (optimization should preserve functionality)

**How to detect it**:
- Run 5-level validation after each phase:
  - Level 1: File size checks (wc -l against targets)
  - Level 2: Duplication check (grep README content in CLAUDE.md)
  - Level 3: Pattern loading check (grep '@.claude/patterns' in commands)
  - Level 4: Functionality test (run /generate-prp on test INITIAL.md)
  - Level 5: Token usage (total lines ≤450 per command call)
- Compare before/after validation report results
- Verify all 23 passing criteria still pass

**How to avoid/fix**:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Removed security check during compression
def extract_feature_name(filepath: str) -> str:
    basename = filepath.split("/")[-1]
    return basename.replace("INITIAL_", "").replace(".md", "")
    # MISSING: All 5 security validations!

# ✅ RIGHT - Preserved all 5 security checks
def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, strip_prefix: str = None) -> str:
    """Safely extract feature name with strict validation."""
    # SECURITY CHECK 1: Path traversal in full path
    if ".." in filepath:
        raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {filepath}")

    basename = filepath.split("/")[-1]
    feature = basename.replace(".md", "")
    if strip_prefix:
        feature = feature.replace(strip_prefix, "")

    # SECURITY CHECK 2: Whitelist validation
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', feature):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid feature name: '{feature}'")

    # SECURITY CHECK 3: Length validation
    if len(feature) > 50:
        raise ValueError(f"Feature name too long: {len(feature)} chars (max: 50)")

    # SECURITY CHECK 4: Directory traversal in feature name
    if ".." in feature or "/" in feature or "\\" in feature:
        raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {feature}")

    # SECURITY CHECK 5: Command injection
    dangerous_chars = ['$', '`', ';', '&', '|', '>', '<', '\n', '\r']
    if any(char in feature for char in dangerous_chars):
        raise ValueError(f"Dangerous characters detected: {feature}")

    return feature
```

**Validation loop pattern**:
```bash
# After each compression phase, run full validation
echo "=== Phase 2: Pattern Compression Validation ==="

# Level 1: File sizes
wc -l .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md  # Must be ≤150 lines
wc -l .claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md  # Must be ≤150 lines
wc -l .claude/patterns/quality-gates.md  # Must be ≤150 lines

# Level 3: No pattern loading
grep '@.claude/patterns' .claude/commands/generate-prp.md  # Must be 0 results
grep '@.claude/patterns' .claude/commands/execute-prp.md  # Must be 0 results

# Level 4: Functionality preserved
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_test_feature.md  # Must succeed

# If ANY check fails, STOP and fix before proceeding
```

**Mitigation strategy**: Iterative validation with max 5 fix attempts per phase.

### 3. Premature DRY Abstraction (Wrong Abstraction Worse Than Duplication)

**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Code Quality / Maintainability
**Affects**: Security function extraction, CLAUDE.md deduplication
**Source**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17788738/is-violation-of-dry-principle-always-bad

**What it is**:
Removing "incidental duplication" (code that looks similar but represents different concepts) instead of true knowledge duplication. Sandi Metz: "Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction."

**Why it's a problem**:
- Creates coupling between unrelated concepts
- Makes future changes harder (breaking one breaks both)
- Overly complex abstractions that are hard to understand
- The wrong abstraction creates ongoing costs that compound over time

**How to detect it**:
- Ask: Do these duplicates represent the same **concept** or just similar **syntax**?
- Will these duplicates **evolve independently** or **together**?
- Is the abstraction simpler than the duplication?
- Rule of Three: Have you seen this pattern 3+ times?

**How to avoid/fix**:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Incidental duplication (different concepts)
# generate-prp.md extracts from "INITIAL_feature.md"
# execute-prp.md extracts from "feature.md"
# These are DIFFERENT operations! Forced unification creates complexity:

def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, mode: str) -> str:
    if mode == "generate":
        # Strip INITIAL_ prefix
        feature = basename.replace("INITIAL_", "").replace(".md", "")
    elif mode == "execute":
        # No prefix stripping
        feature = basename.replace(".md", "")
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid mode: {mode}")
    # Now coupled! Changing one affects the other.

# ✅ RIGHT - Flexible parameter (same concept, different inputs)
def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, strip_prefix: str = None) -> str:
    """Safely extract feature name with strict validation.

    Args:
        filepath: Path to feature file
        strip_prefix: Optional prefix to remove (e.g., "INITIAL_")
    """
    basename = filepath.split("/")[-1]
    feature = basename.replace(".md", "")

    if strip_prefix:
        feature = feature.replace(strip_prefix, "")

    # [5 security checks here...]
    return feature

# Usage:
# generate-prp.md
feature = extract_feature_name(initial_md_path, strip_prefix="INITIAL_")

# execute-prp.md
feature = extract_feature_name(prp_path)  # No prefix stripping
```

**When to apply DRY** (safe cases):
- ✅ Identical security function in 2 commands (64 lines) - TRUE duplication
- ✅ README.md content duplicated in CLAUDE.md - TRUE duplication
- ✅ Same Archon health check pattern repeated 10+ times - TRUE duplication

**When to keep duplication** (dangerous cases):
- ❌ Similar-looking code with different business logic
- ❌ Code that will evolve independently (different contexts)
- ❌ Duplication seen only 1-2 times (wait for 3rd occurrence)
- ❌ Abstraction more complex than duplication

**Sandi Metz's Test**: If unsure, prefer duplication. It's easier to extract later than to untangle wrong abstraction.

### 4. Three-Level Disclosure Violation (Lost User Syndrome)

**Severity**: High
**Category**: Information Architecture / Usability
**Affects**: Pattern file references, nested documentation
**Source**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/

**What it is**:
Creating pattern sub-files or nested references beyond the two-level maximum (command→pattern). NN/Group research: "Designs that go beyond 2 disclosure levels typically have low usability because users often get lost."

**Why it's a problem**:
- Users lose track of where they are in the hierarchy
- Exponential context growth (command loads pattern, pattern loads sub-pattern...)
- Defeats token optimization purpose
- Cognitive overload navigating 3+ levels

**How to detect it**:
- Check patterns for references to other patterns
- Look for `See .claude/patterns/...` inside pattern files
- Verify pattern files are self-contained
- Count disclosure levels: command(1) → pattern(2) → ??? (3 = FAIL)

**How to avoid/fix**:

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Three-level disclosure
# .claude/commands/generate-prp.md (Level 1)
Phase 2: Parallel Research
See .claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md for implementation.

# .claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md (Level 2)
## Task Invocation Pattern
See .claude/patterns/task-invocation-details.md for syntax.
# ^^^ LEVEL 3! User is now lost.

# .claude/patterns/task-invocation-details.md (Level 3)
# TOO DEEP! This should be IN parallel-subagents.md

# ✅ RIGHT - Two-level maximum (self-contained pattern)
# .claude/commands/generate-prp.md (Level 1)
Phase 2: Parallel Research
See .claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md for implementation.

# .claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md (Level 2 - SELF-CONTAINED)
## Task Invocation Pattern

```python
# CRITICAL: All Task() calls in SINGLE response
Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-codebase-researcher", ...)
Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-documentation-hunter", ...)
Task(subagent_type="prp-gen-example-curator", ...)
# System waits for ALL to complete before proceeding
```

**Syntax**:
- `subagent_type`: Agent file name without .md extension
- `context`: Dict with all required inputs for that agent
- Return values available after all tasks complete

**Common gotcha**: Forgetting to pass required context fields.
# No Level 3! Everything needed is HERE.
```

**Architecture rule**: Patterns should NEVER reference other patterns. Only commands reference patterns.

**Testing**: Audit all pattern files with `grep "See .claude/patterns" .claude/patterns/*.md` → should return 0 results.

---

## High Priority Gotchas

### 5. Reference Fragility (Broken Cross-File Links)

**Severity**: High
**Category**: Maintainability / Documentation Quality
**Affects**: CLAUDE.md references to README.md, command references to patterns
**Source**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/ + Web research on doc maintenance

**What it is**:
Cross-references break when files are moved, renamed, or restructured. "See README.md#architecture" fails if that section gets renamed to #system-design.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Silent breakage (no errors, just users can't find referenced content)
- Maintenance burden (updating all references when restructuring)
- User frustration (following broken links)
- Defeats DRY purpose if references don't work

**How to detect it**:
- Manually verify all cross-references after changes
- Use relative paths (not absolute URLs)
- Document reference map (what references what)
- Test: Click/search every "See [file]" reference

**How to avoid/fix**:

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Fragile references
# CLAUDE.md
See README.md section "Current Architecture" for details.
# PROBLEM: If section renamed to "System Design", reference breaks silently

# Also wrong:
See README.md lines 15-35 for architecture.
# PROBLEM: If content moves, line numbers are wrong

# ✅ RIGHT - Robust references
# CLAUDE.md
## Repository Overview
See README.md for full architecture, directory structure, and MCP server details.

**Key differences for Claude Code**:
- `.claude/` directory: Custom agents, commands, and patterns
- ARCHON-FIRST RULE: Use Archon MCP for all task management
- PRP workflow: /generate-prp and /execute-prp for feature implementation

# Better: Reference entire document, not specific sections
# If section-specific needed, use GitHub anchor syntax with fallback:
See [README.md - Architecture](../README.md#architecture) (search for "Directory Structure" if link breaks)
```

**Reference maintenance checklist**:
- ✅ Use relative paths (../README.md, not /absolute/path)
- ✅ Reference whole documents, not sections (more stable)
- ✅ Include fallback search terms if specific section referenced
- ✅ Document reference map in PRP (what references what)
- ✅ Test all references after file moves/renames

**Detection automation**:
```bash
# Check all references exist
grep -n "See README.md" .claude/CLAUDE.md
grep -n "See .claude/patterns/" .claude/commands/*.md
# Manually verify each reference target exists
```

---

### 6. Token Budget Miscalculation (Missing Hidden Context)

**Severity**: High
**Category**: Performance / Token Optimization
**Affects**: Total context per command call (target: ≤450 lines)
**Source**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents

**What it is**:
Counting only explicit file sizes but missing context that gets loaded automatically (frontmatter, system prompts, tool descriptions, implicit includes). Anthropic: "Context rot happens gradually - requires periodic compression."

**Why it's a problem**:
- Actual context exceeds target despite file size reductions
- Token billing higher than expected
- Performance degradation from oversized context
- Fails to achieve 59% reduction goal

**How to detect it**:
- Use `/context` command to see actual token usage
- Count ALL files loaded per command (not just command file itself)
- Include: CLAUDE.md + pattern files + templates + frontmatter
- Measure before/after with same test case

**How to avoid/fix**:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Incomplete calculation
# Just counting command file size:
wc -l .claude/commands/generate-prp.md  # 330 lines
# "We're under 450! Success!"
# ACTUAL context loaded:
# - CLAUDE.md: 100 lines
# - generate-prp.md: 330 lines
# - Tool descriptions: 50 lines (implicit)
# - Frontmatter: 20 lines (implicit)
# TOTAL: 500 lines (OVER TARGET!)

# ✅ RIGHT - Complete calculation
echo "=== Context Calculation for /generate-prp ==="

# Explicit loads
echo "CLAUDE.md: $(wc -l < .claude/CLAUDE.md) lines"
echo "generate-prp.md: $(wc -l < .claude/commands/generate-prp.md) lines"

# Patterns referenced (documentation style, not @ loaded)
echo "Pattern references (not loaded): archon-workflow, parallel-subagents, quality-gates, security-validation"

# Implicit loads (estimate)
echo "Tool descriptions (implicit): ~50 lines"
echo "Agent frontmatter (implicit): ~20 lines per subagent × 5 = ~100 lines"

# Calculate total
claude_lines=$(wc -l < .claude/CLAUDE.md)
command_lines=$(wc -l < .claude/commands/generate-prp.md)
implicit_lines=150  # Tool descriptions + frontmatter estimate

total=$((claude_lines + command_lines + implicit_lines))
echo "TOTAL CONTEXT: $total lines (target: ≤450)"

if [ $total -gt 450 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ OVER TARGET by $((total - 450)) lines"
else
    echo "✅ Under target by $((450 - total)) lines"
fi
```

**Measurement strategy**:
1. Test with IDENTICAL INITIAL.md before and after refactoring
2. Use `/context` command at start of generation
3. Count all loaded files (explicit + implicit)
4. Document calculation method in validation report

**Implicit context sources** (often missed):
- Tool descriptions (50-100 lines depending on enabled tools)
- Agent frontmatter (20 lines × number of subagents invoked)
- System prompts (varies)
- MCP server metadata (if Archon enabled)

---

### 7. Pattern Loading Anti-Pattern (Defeating Progressive Disclosure)

**Severity**: High
**Category**: Architecture / Token Optimization
**Affects**: Command files, token budget
**Source**: Current validation passing (Level 3 check)

**What it is**:
Using `@.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md` to load pattern content into context instead of documentation-style references. Current system correctly avoids this (validation Level 3 passed).

**Why it's a problem**:
- Loads 120-373 lines PER PATTERN into context (explodes token budget)
- Defeats progressive disclosure (everything loaded upfront)
- Negates all compression work (1,044 lines loaded even after optimization)
- Pattern files meant to be human references, not machine-loaded

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Validation Level 3: Pattern loading check
grep '@.claude/patterns' .claude/commands/generate-prp.md
grep '@.claude/patterns' .claude/commands/execute-prp.md
# Should return 0 results

# If found, calculate impact:
# Each @ load adds full pattern file to context
# archon-workflow.md: 373 lines (before compression) or 120 lines (after)
# 3 pattern @ loads = 360 lines added to 450 line budget = 810 lines (OVER!)
```

**How to avoid/fix**:

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Loading pattern into context
# generate-prp.md
# @.claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md
# ^^^ This loads entire 120-line file into context!

Phase 1: Archon Health Check
[Pattern content now in context...]

# ✅ RIGHT - Documentation-style reference
# generate-prp.md
Phase 1: Archon Health Check

# Health check pattern: See .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md
# Check Archon availability first
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

if not archon_available:
    # Graceful degradation
    project_id = None
    print("ℹ️ Archon unavailable - proceeding without tracking")

# Only essential code inline, reference pattern for details
```

**Correct usage of patterns**:
- Human reference: Developer reads pattern when confused
- Copy-paste source: Developer copies code snippet from pattern
- NOT machine-loaded: Claude doesn't load pattern files automatically

**Quality gate**: `grep '@' .claude/commands/*.md | grep -v '#'` should return 0 results (no @ loads except in comments).

---

### 8. Security Check Degradation (Subtle Weakening)

**Severity**: High
**Category**: Security
**Affects**: extract_feature_name() function (5 checks)
**Source**: prps/prp_context_cleanup validation report

**What it is**:
Accidentally weakening security validations during refactoring. Example: Changing `if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', feature)` to `if re.match(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]', feature)` (subtle logic reversal).

**Why it's a problem**:
- Path traversal attacks (../ in paths)
- Command injection ($, backticks, pipes)
- Directory escape (breaking scoped directories)
- Data validation bypass
- Silent security regression (tests might pass but vulnerabilities introduced)

**How to detect it**:
- Compare extracted function line-by-line with original
- Test with malicious inputs: `../../etc/passwd`, `feature; rm -rf /`, `test$(whoami)`
- Verify all 5 checks present: whitelist, traversal, length, directory, injection
- Run security test suite (if available)

**How to avoid/fix**:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Weakened validation (subtle logic error)
def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, strip_prefix: str = None) -> str:
    # Check 1: Looks good
    if ".." in filepath:
        raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {filepath}")

    basename = filepath.split("/")[-1]
    feature = basename.replace(".md", "")
    if strip_prefix:
        feature = feature.replace(strip_prefix, "")

    # Check 2: WRONG! Logic reversed (now allows INVALID characters)
    if re.match(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]', feature):  # ❌ Matches if INVALID chars present
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid feature name: '{feature}'")
    # Should be: if NOT match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$')

    # Check 3: MISSING! No length validation

    # Check 4: WEAK! Only checks ".." but not "/" or "\"
    if ".." in feature:
        raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {feature}")

    # Check 5: MISSING! No command injection check

    return feature
# This function would FAIL security tests!

# ✅ RIGHT - All 5 checks preserved EXACTLY
def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, strip_prefix: str = None) -> str:
    """Safely extract feature name with strict validation.

    Security: 5 checks (whitelist, traversal, length, directory, injection)
    """
    # CHECK 1: Path traversal in full path
    if ".." in filepath:
        raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected in filepath: {filepath}")

    basename = filepath.split("/")[-1]
    feature = basename.replace(".md", "")
    if strip_prefix:
        feature = feature.replace(strip_prefix, "")

    # CHECK 2: Whitelist validation (only safe characters)
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', feature):
        raise ValueError(
            f"Invalid feature name: '{feature}'\n"
            f"Must contain only: letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores\n"
            f"Examples: user_auth, web-scraper, apiClient123"
        )

    # CHECK 3: Length validation (prevent resource exhaustion)
    if len(feature) > 50:
        raise ValueError(f"Feature name too long: {len(feature)} chars (max: 50)")

    # CHECK 4: Directory traversal in feature name
    if ".." in feature or "/" in feature or "\\" in feature:
        raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {feature}")

    # CHECK 5: Command injection prevention
    dangerous_chars = ['$', '`', ';', '&', '|', '>', '<', '\n', '\r']
    if any(char in feature for char in dangerous_chars):
        raise ValueError(f"Dangerous characters detected: {feature}")

    return feature
```

**Security test cases**:
```python
# Must raise ValueError for all these:
test_cases = [
    "../../etc/passwd",           # Path traversal
    "test; rm -rf /",             # Command injection
    "test$(whoami)",              # Command substitution
    "test`id`",                   # Backtick execution
    "test|cat /etc/passwd",       # Pipe injection
    "test\nmalicious",            # Newline injection
    "test/subdir",                # Directory traversal
    "a" * 51,                     # Length overflow
    "test@feature",               # Special character
    "test feature",               # Space (not in whitelist)
]

# Must succeed:
valid_cases = [
    "user_auth",
    "web-scraper",
    "apiClient123",
    "TEST_Feature-v2",
]
```

**Copy original exactly**: When extracting security functions, use copy-paste, not manual retyping (prevents transcription errors).

## Medium Priority Gotchas

### 9. README.md Duplication Detection Errors (False Negatives)

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: DRY Validation
**Affects**: CLAUDE.md compression (389→100 lines)
**Source**: Codebase analysis

**What it is**:
Missing duplicated content during manual comparison because wording is slightly different ("Vibes is a Claude Code workspace" vs "Vibes workspace for Claude Code") even though meaning is identical.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Grep searches miss paraphrased duplicates
- Manual review tedious for 389-line file
- Risk of leaving duplicates after "cleanup"
- False sense of DRY compliance

**How to handle it**:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Only exact string matching
grep "Vibes is a Claude Code workspace" .claude/CLAUDE.md
# Misses: "Vibes workspace for Claude Code AI development"

# ✅ RIGHT - Semantic section comparison
# 1. Identify duplicate SECTIONS (not just exact strings):
echo "=== README.md Sections ==="
grep "^##" README.md

echo "=== CLAUDE.md Sections ==="
grep "^##" .claude/CLAUDE.md

# 2. Compare section purposes (not exact wording):
# README.md: "## Current Architecture" → describes directory structure
# CLAUDE.md: "## Directory Structure" → SAME PURPOSE, different heading
# → This is semantic duplication!

# 3. Check for content overlap (fuzzy matching):
# README.md talks about "MCP servers" in lines 20-45
# CLAUDE.md talks about "MCP Servers" in lines 39-65
# → Compare these sections manually for duplication

# 4. Create duplication map:
echo "=== Duplication Map ===" > duplication-map.txt
echo "CLAUDE.md lines 5-35 → README.md lines 1-35 (Repository Overview)" >> duplication-map.txt
echo "CLAUDE.md lines 39-65 → README.md lines 20-45 (MCP Servers)" >> duplication-map.txt
# Use this map during compression
```

**Semantic duplication checklist**:
- ✅ Same **information** (regardless of wording)
- ✅ Same **purpose** (e.g., both describe architecture)
- ✅ Same **scope** (e.g., both cover MCP servers)
- ✅ Could be **referenced instead of duplicated**

**Target sections with high duplication**:
- Repository Overview (100% duplicate)
- Directory Structure (100% duplicate)
- MCP Server descriptions (95% duplicate)
- Quick Start commands (100% duplicate)
- Key Technologies (90% duplicate)

**Replacement pattern**:
```markdown
# Instead of duplicating 60 lines:
## MCP Servers
- mcp-vibesbox-server: Python-based MCP server...
  [60 lines of detailed descriptions]

# Use 3-line reference:
## MCP Servers
See README.md for full MCP server details (vibesbox, vibes, monitor).

**CLAUDE-specific notes**: `.claude/agents/` directory contains MCP-aware subagents.
```

### 10. Scoped Directory Pattern Loss (Global Pollution Returns)

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Architecture / File Organization
**Affects**: Directory creation in commands
**Source**: prps/prp_context_cleanup validation report

**What it is**:
Accidentally reverting to global directory pattern during command compression. Original problem: `prps/research/` (global). Fixed pattern: `prps/{feature}/planning/` (scoped).

**Why it's confusing**:
- Easy to miss during code review (looks harmless)
- Breaks parallel PRP generation (file conflicts)
- Pollution creeps back subtly
- Defeats original cleanup purpose

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check for global directory patterns
grep "mkdir -p prps/research" .claude/commands/*.md
grep "mkdir -p prps/examples" .claude/commands/*.md
grep "mkdir -p prps/planning" .claude/commands/*.md
# Should return 0 results (all should be scoped)

# Correct pattern check:
grep "mkdir -p prps/\${feature" .claude/commands/*.md
grep "mkdir -p prps/.*{feature" .claude/commands/*.md
# Should find all directory creation commands
```

**How to handle**:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Global directories (pollution risk)
mkdir -p prps/research/
mkdir -p prps/examples/
mkdir -p prps/planning/
# Multiple features write to SAME directories → conflicts!

# ✅ RIGHT - Scoped per-feature
mkdir -p prps/${feature_name}/planning
mkdir -p prps/${feature_name}/examples
mkdir -p prps/${feature_name}/execution
# Each feature has OWN directories → no conflicts

# During compression, preserve scoped pattern:
# Before (verbose):
echo "Creating per-feature scoped directories to prevent global pollution"
echo "This ensures parallel PRP generation doesn't conflict"
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/planning")
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/examples")

# After (compressed but SAME logic):
# Create scoped directories (prevents parallel conflicts)
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/planning")
Bash(f"mkdir -p prps/{feature_name}/examples")
```

**Why scoping matters**:
- Parallel execution: 2 PRPs can generate simultaneously
- Easy cleanup: Delete entire `prps/{feature}/` directory
- Organization: All feature artifacts in one place
- No conflicts: Feature A and Feature B don't interfere

**Validation**: After compression, verify ALL mkdir commands use `{feature_name}` variable.

### 11. Archon Graceful Degradation Loss (Hard Failures)

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Reliability / User Experience
**Affects**: Archon health check pattern in commands
**Source**: .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md

**What it is**:
Removing graceful degradation logic during compression, causing commands to fail completely if Archon unavailable instead of continuing without tracking.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Works fine when Archon available (hides the bug)
- Fails in production when Archon service down
- User experience degrades (can't generate PRPs)
- Defeats "graceful degradation" pattern purpose

**How to detect it**:
```python
# Test with Archon unavailable
# Disable Archon MCP server, then run:
/generate-prp prps/INITIAL_test.md

# Should succeed with warning:
# "ℹ️ Archon unavailable - proceeding without project tracking"

# If it crashes instead → graceful degradation lost
```

**How to handle**:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - No error handling (hard failure)
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
# If this raises exception, entire command fails!

project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create", ...)
# If Archon down, command crashes here

# ✅ RIGHT - Graceful degradation preserved
try:
    health = mcp__archon__health_check()
    archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
except Exception as e:
    archon_available = False
    print(f"ℹ️ Archon health check failed: {e}")

if archon_available:
    # Use Archon features
    project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create", title=feature_name, ...)
    project_id = project["id"]
    print(f"✅ Archon project created: {project_id}")
else:
    # Graceful fallback
    project_id = None
    print("ℹ️ Archon unavailable - proceeding without project tracking")

# Rest of command continues regardless of Archon status
```

**During compression**:
```python
# Verbose version (373 lines):
# [Long explanation of why health check matters]
# [Multiple paragraphs on graceful degradation]
# [Examples of error handling]

# Compressed version (120 lines):
# Health check (see pattern for details)
try:
    health = mcp__archon__health_check()
    archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
except Exception:
    archon_available = False  # Graceful degradation

# MUST preserve try/except and fallback logic even when compressing!
```

**Critical**: Never remove error handling or fallback logic during compression.

### 12. Pattern README Index Staleness (Outdated Reference Table)

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Documentation Maintenance
**Affects**: .claude/patterns/README.md
**Source**: Pattern file organization

**What it is**:
Creating new `security-validation.md` pattern but forgetting to update `.claude/patterns/README.md` index. Developers can't find the new pattern.

**Why it's confusing**:
- Pattern exists but not discoverable
- Duplicates work (creating patterns that already exist)
- Breaks "Before implementing, check patterns" workflow
- Index is supposed to be quick reference

**How to detect it**:
```bash
# Check all pattern files
ls -1 .claude/patterns/*.md

# Check index
grep "security-validation" .claude/patterns/README.md
# Should find entry for security-validation.md

# Automated check:
echo "=== Pattern Files vs Index ==="
for pattern in .claude/patterns/*.md; do
    basename=$(basename "$pattern")
    if [ "$basename" != "README.md" ]; then
        grep -q "$basename" .claude/patterns/README.md || echo "❌ MISSING: $basename"
    fi
done
```

**How to handle**:

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Created security-validation.md but README.md unchanged
.claude/patterns/
├── README.md (still lists only 3 patterns)
├── archon-workflow.md
├── parallel-subagents.md
├── quality-gates.md
└── security-validation.md ← NEW but not in README!

# ✅ RIGHT - Update README.md index
# .claude/patterns/README.md

## Pattern Index

**Need to...** | **See Pattern** | **Used By**
---|---|---
Integrate with Archon MCP | [archon-workflow.md](archon-workflow.md) | generate-prp, execute-prp
Execute subagents in parallel | [parallel-subagents.md](parallel-subagents.md) | Phase 2 workflows
Validate PRP/execution quality | [quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md) | Phase 5, Phase 4
Extract secure feature names | [security-validation.md](security-validation.md) | All commands ← ADDED
```

**Update checklist when adding patterns**:
- ✅ Create pattern file (.claude/patterns/new-pattern.md)
- ✅ Add row to README.md table (Need to... | See Pattern | Used By)
- ✅ Update pattern count (was 3, now 4)
- ✅ Reference pattern in relevant commands
- ✅ Test: Can someone find this pattern from README?

## Low Priority Gotchas

### 13. Inconsistent Compression Ratios (File Size Imbalance)

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Code Quality / Consistency
**Affects**: Pattern files compression
**Source**: Target consistency goals

**What it is**:
Compressing one pattern file to 95 lines and another to 145 lines when target is 120 lines each. Creates inconsistent developer experience.

**Why it's minor**:
- All files still under 150-line hard limit
- Functionality preserved
- Doesn't break validation
- Aesthetic/consistency issue only

**How to handle**:

```bash
# Check compression consistency
wc -l .claude/patterns/archon-workflow.md      # 95 lines
wc -l .claude/patterns/parallel-subagents.md   # 145 lines
wc -l .claude/patterns/quality-gates.md        # 120 lines

# Variance: 95-145 lines (50-line spread)
# Ideally: 110-130 lines (20-line spread for consistency)
```

**Balancing approach**:
- If one pattern significantly shorter (95 lines): Check if critical content removed
- If one pattern significantly longer (145 lines): Check if more compression possible
- Aim for ±10 lines from target (110-130 lines)
- Hard limit enforcement more important than perfect balance

**Acceptable variance**: 110-130 lines (120±10)
**Concerning variance**: 90-150 lines (requires review)

---

### 14. Comment Compression Over-Zealousness (Lost Context Breadcrumbs)

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Code Quality
**Affects**: Inline comments in code examples
**Source**: 80%+ code density target

**What it is**:
Removing ALL comments from code examples to maximize code density, losing helpful context breadcrumbs.

**How to handle**:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - No comments (what does this do?)
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"
if archon_available:
    project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create", title=feature_name)
    project_id = project["id"]
else:
    project_id = None

# ✅ RIGHT - Minimal essential comments
# Check Archon availability before using features
health = mcp__archon__health_check()
archon_available = health["status"] == "healthy"

if archon_available:
    project = mcp__archon__manage_project("create", title=feature_name)
    project_id = project["id"]
else:
    # Graceful degradation
    project_id = None
```

**Comment guidelines for reference cards**:
- ✅ Keep: Security warnings, gotcha alerts, "why" explanations
- ✅ Keep: Unusual syntax explanations
- ✅ Keep: Return value descriptions
- ❌ Remove: Obvious descriptions ("create variable")
- ❌ Remove: Redundant field docs (already in function signature)

**80/20 ratio calculation**:
- Count code lines vs comment/prose lines
- Inline comments count as CODE (they're part of the snippet)
- Section headers count as PROSE
- Aim: 80%+ of lines are code/inline-comments

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Grep-Driven DRY (Removing All String Matches)

**What it is**:
Running `grep "common phrase" *.md` and removing every match without considering context.

**Why it's bad**:
- Destroys semantic meaning
- Removes necessary repetition (e.g., critical warnings repeated for emphasis)
- Creates incomplete references

**Better pattern**:
```markdown
# Don't just search for "Vibes is a Claude Code workspace" and delete
# Ask: Is this the SAME information as README.md or different context?

# README.md (user-facing):
"Vibes is a Claude Code workspace for AI-assisted development"
→ Explains to new users what Vibes is

# CLAUDE.md (AI-facing):
"Vibes is a Claude Code workspace for AI-assisted development"
→ Orients Claude to the codebase
→ SAME purpose → TRUE duplication → can reference README

# Command documentation:
"Generate PRPs for Claude Code workspace features"
→ DIFFERENT purpose (task description) → NOT duplication → keep as-is
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Hard-Coding File Paths (Breaking Portability)

**What it is**:
Using absolute paths in cross-references: `/Users/jon/vibes/README.md` instead of relative paths.

**Why it's bad**:
- Breaks on other machines
- Breaks when project cloned
- Not portable across environments

**Better pattern**:
```markdown
# ❌ WRONG
See /Users/jon/source/vibes/README.md for details
See C:\Users\developer\vibes\README.md for details

# ✅ RIGHT
See README.md for details
See ../README.md for details (from .claude/ directory)
See [README.md](../README.md) for details (Markdown link)
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Inline Pattern Duplication (Defeating Extraction Purpose)

**What it is**:
Extracting security function to pattern but still including full implementation inline in commands "for convenience."

**Why it's bad**:
- Negates DRY benefits
- Maintenance burden (update two places)
- Increases context (defeats compression)

**Better pattern**:
```markdown
# ❌ WRONG
# .claude/patterns/security-validation.md
[34 lines of security function]

# .claude/commands/generate-prp.md
# For convenience, full implementation here:
def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, strip_prefix: str = None):
    [34 lines of same function]
# Now 68 lines total (duplication!)

# ✅ RIGHT
# .claude/patterns/security-validation.md
[34 lines of security function]

# .claude/commands/generate-prp.md
# See .claude/patterns/security-validation.md for implementation
feature_name = extract_feature_name(initial_md_path, strip_prefix="INITIAL_")
# Only 2 lines in command (reference + usage)
```

---

## Gotcha Checklist for Implementation

Before marking PRP complete, verify these gotchas are addressed:

- [ ] **Over-compression**: Pattern files scannable and usable (can developer apply them?)
- [ ] **Validation preservation**: All 23/24 criteria still pass (run 5-level validation)
- [ ] **Security intact**: All 5 security checks preserved in extraction
- [ ] **Two-level maximum**: No pattern→sub-pattern references (grep check)
- [ ] **Reference robustness**: Cross-references use relative paths, reference whole docs
- [ ] **Token calculation**: Complete count includes implicit context (CLAUDE.md + commands + tools)
- [ ] **Pattern loading**: No @ syntax in commands (grep check passes)
- [ ] **Scoped directories**: All mkdir use `{feature_name}` variable
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: Archon failure handled (try/except preserved)
- [ ] **README index**: Updated for new security-validation.md pattern
- [ ] **DRY correctness**: Removed true duplication, kept incidental duplication
- [ ] **Compression balance**: Pattern files within 110-130 lines (consistent)

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

When generating the PRP:

1. **Include critical gotchas** in "Known Gotchas & Library Quirks" section:
   - Over-compression breaking clarity (Gotcha #1)
   - Validation regression (Gotcha #2)
   - Premature DRY abstraction (Gotcha #3)
   - Three-level disclosure violation (Gotcha #4)

2. **Reference solutions** in "Implementation Blueprint":
   - Compression checklist (keep security warnings, preserve copy-paste snippets)
   - 5-level validation loop (run after each phase)
   - DRY decision tree (true vs incidental duplication)
   - Two-level architecture rule (commands→patterns, no deeper)

3. **Add detection tests** to validation gates:
   - Pattern usability test (can developer apply without original 373-line version?)
   - Security test cases (malicious inputs must be rejected)
   - Reference verification (all cross-references exist and work)
   - Token budget calculation (complete count including implicit context)

4. **Warn about version issues** in documentation references:
   - NN/Group article from 2022 (pre-LLM era) - combine with Anthropic 2025 guidance
   - No markdown-specific compression guide exists - apply general context engineering

5. **Highlight anti-patterns** to avoid:
   - Grep-driven DRY (removing all string matches without context)
   - Hard-coding file paths (use relative paths)
   - Inline pattern duplication (defeating extraction purpose)
