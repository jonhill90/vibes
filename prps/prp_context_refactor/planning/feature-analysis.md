# Feature Analysis: PRP Context Refactor (Phase 2)

## INITIAL.md Summary

Phase 2 cleanup following successful prp_context_cleanup (95.8% validation pass rate). Focus: Eliminate remaining context pollution through CLAUDE.md deduplication, pattern file compression (tutorial→reference card), security function extraction, and command optimization. Target: 59% total context reduction (1,044→430 lines per command call) while preserving all functionality and 95.8%+ validation success rate.

## Core Requirements

### Explicit Requirements

1. **File Size Targets (Hard Limits)**:
   - CLAUDE.md: ≤120 lines (target 100, currently 389) = 74% reduction
   - Pattern files: ≤150 lines each (target 120, currently 373-387) = 68% reduction
   - Commands: ≤350 lines each (target 330, currently 655/663) = 50% reduction
   - Security duplication: 0 lines (currently 64 unique lines across 2 files)
   - **Total context per command**: ≤450 lines (target 430, currently 1,044) = 59% reduction

2. **Functionality Preservation (Critical)**:
   - MUST maintain 95.8%+ validation success rate (23/24 criteria)
   - MUST preserve all 5 security checks (whitelist, path traversal, command injection, length, directory traversal)
   - MUST preserve scoped directory logic
   - MUST preserve parallel execution capability (3x speedup)
   - MUST preserve Archon integration with graceful degradation
   - MUST NOT add new features (optimization only)

3. **Quality Standards**:
   - Pattern files: 80%+ code snippets (≤20% commentary)
   - CLAUDE.md: 0% duplication with README.md
   - Commands: Reference patterns (not duplicate them)
   - Patterns: Copy-paste ready code (not tutorials)
   - Two-level disclosure maximum (command→pattern, done)

4. **Validation Requirements**:
   - File size validation (wc -l checks)
   - Duplication check (grep for README content = 0 results)
   - Pattern loading check (grep '@.claude/patterns' = 0 results)
   - Functionality test (run /generate-prp on test INITIAL.md)
   - Token usage measurement (total lines per command call)

### Implicit Requirements

1. **Progressive Disclosure Philosophy**: Apply two-level maximum principle from NN/Group and Anthropic context engineering guidance (context is finite resource)

2. **DRY Principle Enforcement**: Single source of truth - CLAUDE.md should reference README.md, not duplicate it

3. **Reference Card Style**: Patterns should be like "cheat sheets" - quick lookup, copy-paste ready, minimal explanation

4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain ability to clean up old prps/research/ artifacts (already implemented in prp-cleanup command)

5. **Developer Experience**: Faster to scan and reference, clearer separation of concerns (rules vs reference vs implementation)

## Technical Components

### Data Models

**File Structure Changes**:
```
.claude/
├── patterns/
│   ├── archon-workflow.md (373→120 lines)
│   ├── parallel-subagents.md (387→120 lines)
│   ├── quality-gates.md (385→120 lines)
│   ├── security-validation.md (NEW: 40 lines)
│   └── README.md (57 lines, update index)
├── commands/
│   ├── generate-prp.md (655→330 lines)
│   └── execute-prp.md (663→330 lines)
└── CLAUDE.md (389→100 lines)
```

**Content Density Metrics**:
- Pattern files: 80%+ code snippets, ≤20% commentary
- CLAUDE.md: 100% unique content (0% README duplication)
- Commands: Orchestration only (references to patterns, not implementations)

### External Integrations

**None** - This is a refactoring task with no external dependencies.

**Existing Integrations to Preserve**:
- Archon MCP server integration (health check, project/task management)
- Pattern reference system (documentation-style references, not @ loads)
- Validation report generation (templates in .claude/templates/)

### Core Logic

**Compression Strategy (Per Pattern File)**:
1. **Remove tutorials**: Extensive commentary, multiple variations, detailed explanations
2. **Keep core snippets**: 4-5 copy-paste ready code blocks with minimal comments
3. **Preserve critical rules**: Security warnings, anti-patterns, gotchas
4. **Remove redundancy**: Similar examples, verbose descriptions, repeated field explanations

**Duplication Elimination (CLAUDE.md)**:
1. **Identify duplicates**: grep README.md content in CLAUDE.md
2. **Replace with references**: "See README.md for architecture details"
3. **Keep unique rules**: Archon-first rule, PRP workflow, code standards, pattern references
4. **Target sections**: Repository Overview, Directory Structure, Key Components, MCP Server details

**Security Function Extraction**:
1. **Source locations**: generate-prp.md lines 33-66, execute-prp.md lines 33-66
2. **Unique lines**: 34 lines × 2 files - 2 line overlap = 64 unique lines total
3. **Extraction target**: .claude/patterns/security-validation.md (~40 lines)
4. **Command replacement**: 2 lines each (comment + function call)
5. **Net savings**: 64 - (40 + 4) = 20 lines

**Command Optimization**:
1. **Identify verbose sections**: Phase descriptions, repeated Archon patterns, inline error handling
2. **Condense orchestration**: Keep workflow, remove pseudocode details
3. **Reference patterns**: Replace repeated Archon update patterns with "See archon-workflow.md"
4. **Preserve critical**: Security validation, scoped directory creation, subagent invocation

### UI/CLI Requirements

**None** - No user-facing changes. Internal refactoring only.

**Validation Output** (from validation gates):
- File size checks (pass/fail with line counts)
- Duplication check results (0 matches expected)
- Functionality test results (PRP generation success)
- Token usage report (before/after comparison)

## Similar Implementations Found in Archon

### Search Results Summary

**Context Optimization**: No direct matches found in Archon knowledge base for "context optimization DRY"
**Pattern Extraction**: Found 5 agent-related results from 12-factor-agents and pydantic-ai, but not directly applicable to markdown documentation refactoring
**Code Examples**: Found MCP client setup examples, but not relevant to this markdown compression task

**Key Insight**: This is a novel optimization pattern specific to Claude Code context engineering. No similar PRPs exist in Archon knowledge base.

### 1. 12-Factor Agents - Natural Language to Tool Calls
- **Relevance**: 4/10 (conceptual similarity only)
- **Archon ID**: e9eb05e2bf38f125
- **Key Patterns**: Breaking down complex workflows into atomic steps
- **Applicable Concept**: Just as tool calls should be atomic and focused, documentation should be information-dense and minimal
- **Gotchas**: Over-explaining reduces clarity (same principle applies to context engineering)

### 2. Pydantic-AI Multi-Agent Flow
- **Relevance**: 3/10 (structural similarity only)
- **Archon ID**: c0e629a894699314
- **Key Patterns**: Multi-agent coordination without duplication
- **Applicable Concept**: Subagents reference shared patterns without duplicating them (DRY principle)
- **Gotchas**: None directly applicable

### 3. Original Context Engineering Intro Repository
- **Relevance**: 8/10 (directly applicable philosophy)
- **Location**: repos/context-engineering-intro/README.md
- **Key Patterns**: Original template was 68 + 39 = 107 lines total, current system is 1,318 lines (12x larger)
- **Applicable Concept**: Progressive disclosure, minimal effective context, reference card style
- **Gotchas**: Context bloat happens gradually; requires periodic compression to maintain effectiveness
- **Evidence**: Current CLAUDE.md (389 lines) has drifted 3.6x from original philosophy (~100 lines)

## Recommended Technology Stack

**Existing Stack (No Changes)**:
- **Language**: Markdown (documentation)
- **Version Control**: Git (track changes, rollback if needed)
- **Validation**: Bash/shell scripts (wc -l, grep, test commands)
- **Execution**: Claude Code commands (/generate-prp, /execute-prp)

**Compression Tools (Manual)**:
- Read/Write tools (for file editing)
- Grep (for duplication detection)
- Line counting (wc -l equivalent via Read tool + line count)

**Testing**:
- Validation gates (5-level validation from prp_context_cleanup)
- Functionality test (run /generate-prp on test INITIAL.md)
- Metrics tracking (before/after line counts, context usage)

## Assumptions Made

### 1. **Pattern File Compression Ratio**: 68% reduction is achievable
   - **Reasoning**: Current pattern files are 373-387 lines (tutorial style). Converting to reference card style with 4-5 core snippets + minimal commentary should yield 120 lines each.
   - **Source**: Progressive disclosure best practices (NN/Group, Anthropic context engineering)
   - **Risk**: May need 150 lines if critical examples can't be condensed
   - **Mitigation**: Hard limit is 150 lines, target is 120 lines (built-in buffer)

### 2. **CLAUDE.md Duplication**: ~60% duplicates README.md
   - **Reasoning**: Manual inspection shows Repository Overview, Directory Structure, Key Components, and MCP Server sections repeat README.md content
   - **Source**: Validation report mentions duplication, INITIAL.md specifies 60%
   - **Evidence**: README.md has sections on "Current Architecture", "Directory Structure" that match CLAUDE.md lines 5-35, 11-35
   - **Target**: Remove ~234 lines of duplication, keep ~100 lines of unique rules

### 3. **Command Verbosity**: 50% is verbose orchestration
   - **Reasoning**: Validation report shows 116 line increase was justified by security/scoping features. Original 582/620 lines can be optimized by condensing phase descriptions and referencing patterns.
   - **Source**: INITIAL.md analysis, validation report notes
   - **Evidence**: Phase descriptions include extensive context setup that can be condensed (e.g., "Prepare ALL contexts first" can reference parallel-subagents.md)
   - **Target**: 330 lines each (50% reduction from 655/663)

### 4. **Security Function**: 64 unique lines across 2 files
   - **Reasoning**: Both commands have identical extract_feature_name() function at lines 33-66 (34 lines each)
   - **Source**: Read tool inspection, INITIAL.md specification
   - **Evidence**: Function is 31 lines (lines 33-63) + 2 lines for invocation = 33 lines × 2 files - 1 line overlap = 65 lines (INITIAL says 64, close enough)
   - **Target**: Extract to security-validation.md (40 lines), replace with 2-line reference in each command

### 5. **Validation Preservation**: 95.8%+ success rate must be maintained
   - **Reasoning**: Current implementation passes 23/24 criteria. Optimization must not break functionality.
   - **Source**: prps/prp_context_cleanup/execution/validation-report.md
   - **Evidence**: All functional criteria (security, scoping, patterns) already pass
   - **Validation**: Run same 5-level validation after each phase

### 6. **No Pattern Loading**: Commands must reference, not @ load patterns
   - **Reasoning**: Current implementation correctly references patterns with "See .claude/patterns/..." (documentation style). This must be preserved.
   - **Source**: Validation report Level 3 (pattern loading check passed)
   - **Evidence**: grep '@.claude/patterns' in commands = 0 results
   - **Principle**: Progressive disclosure (commands describe workflow, patterns provide implementation details)

### 7. **Two-Level Disclosure Maximum**: Command → Pattern (done)
   - **Reasoning**: Best practice from NN/Group progressive disclosure research
   - **Source**: INITIAL.md documentation references, Anthropic context engineering principles
   - **Evidence**: Current system already follows this (commands reference patterns, patterns don't reference sub-patterns)
   - **Anti-pattern**: Creating pattern sub-directories or nested pattern references would violate this principle
