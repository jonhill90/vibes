## Validation Report Metrics Format

```markdown
## Level 5: Token Usage Measurement

### Final State (Iteration 3)
```
CLAUDE.md: 107 lines
generate-prp.md: 320 lines (compressed)
execute-prp.md: 202 lines

/generate-prp total: 107 + 320 = 427 lines (target: ≤450) - PASS ✅
/execute-prp total: 107 + 202 = 309 lines (target: ≤450) - PASS ✅

/generate-prp reduction: (1044 - 427) / 1044 = 59% (target: ≥59%) - PASS ✅
/execute-prp reduction: (1044 - 309) / 1044 = 70% (target: ≥59%) - PASS ✅
```

### Compression Summary
- Overall file compression: 19% (1359 → 1096 lines)
- /generate-prp context: 59% reduction (1044 → 427 lines)
- /execute-prp context: 70% reduction (1044 → 309 lines)
- Largest single compression: execute-prp.md 59% (494 → 202 lines)
```

## What to Mimic

### 1. **Before → After Format**
```markdown
Component: X lines → Y lines (Z% reduction)
```

### 2. **Calculation Transparency**
Show the math:
```markdown
(original - new) / original = percentage
(1044 - 427) / 1044 = 59%
```

### 3. **Target Comparison**
```markdown
Result: X lines (target: ≤Y) - PASS ✅
```

### 4. **Summary Table**
```markdown
| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| CLAUDE.md | 143 | 107 | 25% |
| Patterns  | varies | 47-150 | varies |
```

### 5. **Hierarchical Presentation**
- Overall metrics first
- Per-component breakdown second
- Individual file details third

## What to Adapt for README

### Simple Achievement Format (for README.md)
```markdown
## Context Optimization

Vibes achieved **59-70% token reduction** through aggressive context engineering:

**File Sizes Achieved**:
- **CLAUDE.md**: 107 lines (from 143, 25% reduction)
- **Patterns**: 47-150 lines each (target ≤150)
- **Commands**: 202-320 lines each (target ≤350)

**Context Per Command**:
- `/generate-prp`: 427 lines (59% reduction from 1044 baseline)
- `/execute-prp`: 309 lines (70% reduction from 1044 baseline)

**Impact**: ~320,400 tokens saved annually (assuming 10 PRP workflows/month)

See [validation report](prps/prp_context_refactor/execution/validation-report.md) for detailed metrics.
```

### Why This Format Works
1. **Bold numbers** draw attention to achievements
2. **Percentages** show relative improvement
3. **Line counts** show absolute compression
4. **Real impact** (token savings) shows business value
5. **Link to details** provides progressive disclosure

## What to Skip

- Don't show iteration details (validation report has that)
- Don't show calculation math (just results)
- Don't list every file (summarize as ranges)
- Don't use validation table format (too verbose for README)

## Pattern Highlights

### Achievement Presentation Pattern
```markdown
[System] achieved **[Metric]** through [Method]:

**[Category 1]**:
- **[Item 1]**: [Value] ([Context])
- **[Item 2]**: [Value] ([Context])

**[Category 2]**:
- [Summary stats]

**Impact**: [Real-world benefit]
```

### File Compression Summary Pattern
```markdown
- **File.md**: X lines (from Y, Z% reduction)
- **Category**: X-Y lines each (target ≤Z)
```

### Percentage Format
- Use **bold** for percentages: **59-70%**
- Include direction: "reduction", "improvement", "savings"
- Show range when components vary: 59-70%, 47-150 lines

## Why This Example

The validation report successfully communicated complex metrics to both technical and non-technical audiences. The format shows:
1. Quick wins at the top (59-70% reduction)
2. Component details for those who care
3. Links to full details for deep divers

This proven pattern should be adapted for the README's Context Optimization section, but simplified since README is more of a marketing/overview document vs. validation report which is technical proof.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't do this**:
```markdown
Token reduction was achieved. Files are smaller now.
```
- Too vague, no numbers

❌ **Don't do this**:
```markdown
CLAUDE.md: 107 lines
archon-workflow.md: 133 lines
parallel-subagents.md: 150 lines
quality-gates.md: 128 lines
security-validation.md: 47 lines
generate-prp.md: 320 lines
execute-prp.md: 202 lines
```
- Wall of numbers, no context

❌ **Don't do this**:
```markdown
We leveraged advanced compression algorithms to optimize our context engineering pipeline, resulting in a synergistic reduction of approximately 59-70% across multiple file artifacts.
```
- Corporate speak, not conversational

✅ **Do this**:
```markdown
**59-70% token reduction** achieved:
- CLAUDE.md: 107 lines (25% smaller)
- Commands: 202-320 lines (59-70% smaller)
- Impact: ~320k tokens saved annually
```
- Clear, quantified, conversational
