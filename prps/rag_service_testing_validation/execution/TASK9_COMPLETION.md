## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Pre-Flight Checks
- **Browser Installation Check**: Verifies browser binaries are installed, auto-installs if missing
- **Services Health Check**: Verifies frontend service is running on port 5173
- **Auto-Remediation**: Automatically starts services if not running
- **Pattern**: Follows Example 5 (browser_validation_workflow.py) pre-flight pattern

#### 2. Delete Workflow Validation
- **Navigate to Page**: Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and verify page loaded
- **Initial State Capture**: Use browser_snapshot() to capture page state
- **Click Delete Button**: Use semantic query "button containing 'Delete'"
- **Wait for Modal**: browser_wait_for(text="Confirm Delete", timeout=5000)
- **Modal Content Validation**: Verify modal shows warning message and buttons
- **Confirm Deletion**: Click "Delete Document" button in modal
- **Success Message**: Wait for "deleted successfully" message
- **Final State Validation**: Verify modal closed and list still displayed

#### 3. Validation Checks
**Modal Validation**:
- Confirm Delete title present
- Warning message present ("cannot be undone" or "Are you sure")
- Delete button present
- Cancel button present

**Final State Validation**:
- Modal closed (no "Confirm Delete" in state)
- List still visible (Documents Management present)
- Success message shown

#### 4. Error Handling
- **Navigation Errors**: Screenshot on navigation failure
- **Missing Documents**: Skip test gracefully if no documents available
- **Modal Timeout**: Screenshot if modal doesn't appear
- **Validation Failures**: Screenshot with detailed error reporting
- **Click Failures**: Try alternative button texts, screenshot on failure

#### 5. Screenshots for Human Proof
- **Success**: `delete-operations-proof.png` - Final state after successful deletion
- **Error States**: Multiple error screenshots for debugging failures

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Browser Binaries Not Installed (PRP lines 283-298)
**Implementation**:
```python
def check_browser_installed() -> bool:
    try:
        browser_navigate(url="about:blank")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        if "Executable doesn't exist" in str(e):
            return False
        return False

def install_browser():
    from mcp import browser_install
    browser_install()
    time.sleep(30)  # Wait for installation
```
**Result**: Auto-installs browser if missing, prevents "Executable doesn't exist" errors

#### Gotcha #2: Frontend Services Not Running (PRP lines 300-318)
**Implementation**:
```python
def check_services_running() -> bool:
    result = subprocess.run(["curl", "-s", "http://localhost:5173"], ...)
    if "Connection refused" in result.stderr:
        return False
    return True

def start_services():
    subprocess.run(["docker-compose", "up", "-d"], ...)
    time.sleep(10)
```
**Result**: Auto-starts services if not running, prevents connection refused errors

#### Gotcha #3: Element Refs Change Every Render (PRP lines 346-359)
**Implementation**:
```python
# ✅ Using semantic queries (stable)
browser_click(element="button containing 'Delete'")
browser_click(element="button containing 'Delete Document'")

# ❌ NOT using refs (brittle)
# browser_click(ref="e5")  # This would break on re-render
```
**Result**: Stable element selection that works across re-renders

#### Gotcha #4: Screenshots for Validation Anti-Pattern (PRP lines 409-424)
**Implementation**:
```python
# ✅ Use accessibility tree for validation
initial_state = browser_snapshot()
if "Documents Management" not in initial_state:
    raise AssertionError("Page not loaded")

# ✅ Screenshot for human proof only (after validation)
browser_take_screenshot(filename="delete-operations-proof.png")
```
**Result**: Agent-parseable validation with human-readable proof

#### Gotcha #5: Auto-Wait vs Manual sleep() (PRP lines 1158-1166)
**Implementation**:
```python
# ✅ Use auto-wait with conditions
browser_wait_for(text="Confirm Delete", timeout=5000)
browser_wait_for(text="deleted successfully", timeout=10000)

# ❌ NOT using manual sleep
# time.sleep(3)  # Would be flaky
```
**Result**: Reliable waits that adapt to actual page behavior

#### Gotcha #6: Two-Step Delete Confirmation (Example 4, lines 103-145)
**Pattern Followed**: Delete confirmation modal from DocumentsManagement.tsx
```python
# Step 1: Click delete button → opens modal
browser_click(element="button containing 'Delete'")

# Step 2: Wait for modal
browser_wait_for(text="Confirm Delete")

# Step 3: Validate modal content
modal_state = browser_snapshot()
assert "Confirm Delete" in modal_state
assert "cannot be undone" in modal_state

# Step 4: Confirm deletion
browser_click(element="button containing 'Delete Document'")
```
**Result**: Validates two-step delete pattern prevents accidental deletions

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 10 (DocumentsManagement.tsx)**: Component exists with delete confirmation modal (verified by reading file)
  - Modal shows "Confirm Delete" title (line 329)
  - Modal shows warning about "cannot be undone" (line 331-332)
  - Modal has "Delete Document" button (line 336-339)
  - Modal has "Cancel" button (line 341-346)
