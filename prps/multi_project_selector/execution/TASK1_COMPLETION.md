## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. ProjectStorage Class with Static Methods
- **get()**: Retrieves selected project ID from localStorage with fallback
- **set(projectId)**: Saves project ID with quota handling and retry logic
- **clear()**: Removes stored project ID from both localStorage and in-memory

#### 2. localStorage Availability Detection
- **checkAvailability()**: Tests localStorage access with test key
- Caches result to avoid repeated checks
- Returns false in private browsing mode, disabled cookies, or security errors
- Logs warning when falling back to in-memory storage

#### 3. Cross-Browser Quota Error Detection
- **isQuotaExceeded(e)**: Detects quota errors across browsers
- Handles error code 22 (standard browsers)
- Handles error code 1014 with name 'NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED' (Firefox)
- Handles error number -2147024882 (Internet Explorer 8)
- Checks error name 'QuotaExceededError' as fallback

#### 4. In-Memory Fallback
- Static property `inMemoryFallback` stores value when localStorage unavailable
- Updated on every set() call (even if localStorage write fails)
- Prevents app crashes in private browsing mode or restricted environments
- Graceful degradation - app works without persistence

#### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling
- All localStorage access wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Specific handling for quota exceeded errors (clear and retry)
- Generic handling for other errors (fall back to in-memory)
- Console logging for debugging without throwing exceptions

#### 6. Automatic Retry on Quota Exceeded
- When quota exceeded, clears stored key to free space
- Retries write after clearing
- Falls back to in-memory if retry also fails
- User-friendly console warnings explain what happened

#### 7. Graceful Error Returns
- get() returns null on any error (never throws)
- set() degrades to in-memory on error (never throws)
- clear() logs error but continues (never throws)
- Application remains stable even when localStorage completely broken

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #3: localStorage Quota Exceeded or Security Error
**Implementation**:
- checkAvailability() method tests localStorage before use
- isQuotaExceeded() handles error codes: 22, 1014, -2147024882
- In-memory fallback prevents crashes
- Try-catch wraps all localStorage access
- Automatic retry after clearing storage on quota exceeded

**Why this matters**:
- Safari throws SecurityError in private browsing mode
- Chrome/Firefox have different quota error codes
- Disabled cookies can disable localStorage
- Without this handling, app would crash on first project selection

**Testing approach**:
```typescript
// Private browsing: checkAvailability() returns false, uses inMemoryFallback
// Quota exceeded: isQuotaExceeded() detects error, clears and retries
// Security error: Caught in try-catch, falls back to inMemoryFallback
```

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
None - This is the first task in the implementation sequence

### External Dependencies:
None - Uses browser-native localStorage API only

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:

**Blockers**: None

### Files Created: 1

### Total Lines of Code: ~176 lines

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Static Class Pattern vs. Module Functions
**Decision**: Used static class with private properties
**Reasoning**:
- Allows private static state (inMemoryFallback, isAvailable)
- Clear namespace (ProjectStorage.get/set/clear)
- Matches pattern from example_4 (ThemeContext localStorage usage)
- Singleton behavior appropriate for global storage

### 2. In-Memory Fallback Updated on Every Set
**Decision**: Update inMemoryFallback before attempting localStorage write
**Reasoning**:
- Ensures in-memory state always reflects intent
- If localStorage fails, fallback is already current
- Prevents state inconsistency between localStorage and memory
- Graceful degradation - app works even if localStorage completely broken

### 3. Cached Availability Check
**Decision**: Cache checkAvailability() result in static property
**Reasoning**:
- Avoid repeated test writes on every get/set call
- Performance optimization (localStorage is synchronous)
- Once unavailable, likely stays unavailable (private browsing mode)
- Can be reset if needed by setting isAvailable to null

### 4. Automatic Retry on Quota Exceeded
**Decision**: Clear stored key and retry write on quota error
**Reasoning**:
- Frees up space for current write (we only store one key)
- Increases likelihood of successful save
- Better UX than silent failure
- Still falls back to in-memory if retry fails

### 5. Console Logging Strategy
**Decision**: Warn on availability issues, error on write failures
**Reasoning**:
- console.warn() for expected issues (private browsing)
- console.error() for unexpected failures (write errors)
- Helps debugging without being too verbose
- Production-appropriate (errors are recoverable)

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Cross-Browser Error Code Differences
**Issue**: Different browsers use different error codes for quota exceeded
**Solution**: Implemented isQuotaExceeded() checking all known codes (22, 1014, -2147024882) and error names
**Learning**: Always check both error.code and error.name for browser compatibility

### Challenge 2: Ensuring Never Throws
**Issue**: localStorage can throw in many scenarios, must never crash app
**Solution**:
- Wrapped every localStorage access in try-catch
- All methods return gracefully (null or void)
- In-memory fallback updated before risky operations
**Validation**: Reviewed each method for uncaught exception paths

### Challenge 3: Private Browsing Detection
**Issue**: Some browsers throw on localStorage.getItem, others on setItem
**Solution**: checkAvailability() performs both setItem and removeItem to test full access
**Result**: Detects all private browsing modes (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)

## Integration Notes

**For Next Tasks**:
- Import as `import ProjectStorage from '@/features/projects/utils/projectStorage'`
- Use in KanbanPage for project selection persistence
- Use in ProjectSelector for initialization
- No props or configuration needed - static methods only
- Always check return value of get() for null (project might be deleted)

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// Save selected project
ProjectStorage.set('project-123');

// Retrieve selected project
const projectId = ProjectStorage.get(); // Returns 'project-123' or null

// Clear selection (e.g., when no projects exist)
ProjectStorage.clear();
```

**Validation Pattern** (for KanbanPage integration):
```typescript
// Validate stored ID against available projects
const storedId = ProjectStorage.get();
const storedProjectExists = storedId && projects.some(p => p.id === storedId);

if (storedProjectExists) {
  setSelectedProjectId(storedId);
} else {
  // Stored project was deleted - auto-select first
  const firstProject = projects[0];
  setSelectedProjectId(firstProject.id);
  ProjectStorage.set(firstProject.id);
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Task 2**: Create Query Key Factory and List Query Hook
   - Will use ProjectStorage for default project selection
   - TanStack Query v5 object-based API
   - Smart polling with 30s interval

2. **Testing**: Add unit tests for projectStorage.ts
   - Mock localStorage with quota error
   - Mock localStorage with security error
   - Verify in-memory fallback behavior
   - Test clear() method

3. **Integration**: Use in KanbanPage (Task 7)
   - Initialize selectedProjectId from ProjectStorage.get()
   - Validate stored ID against project list
   - Persist changes with ProjectStorage.set()

**Ready for integration and next steps.**
