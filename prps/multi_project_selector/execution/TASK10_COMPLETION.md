## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. ARIA Labels and Roles
- **All interactive elements** now have descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- **Semantic roles** added: `main`, `banner`, `navigation`, `listbox`, `status`, `alert`, `separator`
- **Dynamic labels** that change based on state (e.g., "Creating project" vs "Create project")
- **Decorative elements** properly hidden with `aria-hidden="true"`

#### 2. Live Regions for Dynamic Content
- **Loading states**: `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical updates
- **Error states**: `aria-live="assertive"` for critical errors that need immediate attention
- **Form validation**: `aria-invalid` dynamically reflects input validation state
- **Button states**: Screen readers announce when buttons are in loading state

#### 3. Form Accessibility
- **Required fields**: Marked with both visual (`*`) and programmatic (`aria-required="true"`, `required`) indicators
- **Form labels**: All inputs properly associated with `<label for="id">` and `id` attributes
- **Field hints**: Optional fields have hidden hints (`sr-only`) for screen readers
- **Validation feedback**: Errors displayed in `role="alert"` containers with `aria-live="assertive"`

#### 4. Focus Management
- **Visible focus indicators**: All interactive elements have `focus:ring-2` styles
- **Dark mode support**: Focus rings properly offset with `dark:focus:ring-offset-gray-900`
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab order follows visual order
- **Modal focus trap**: Radix Dialog automatically manages focus (verified not broken)
- **Auto-focus**: Modal name input gets focus on open (`autoFocus` prop)

#### 5. Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab**: Verified all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Enter**: Submit buttons respond to Enter key
- **Esc**: Modal closes on Escape (unless mutation pending)
- **Arrow keys**: Radix Select handles arrow key navigation automatically
- **Space**: Buttons and selects respond to Space key (Radix built-in)

#### 6. Screen Reader Compatibility
- **Loading spinners**: Announced as "Loading" with `role="status"`
- **Error messages**: Announced immediately with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`
- **Button states**: Dynamic labels announce state changes
- **List items**: Each project announced as "Select project: {name}"
- **Decorative icons**: Hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Radix UI Built-in Accessibility
**Issue**: Radix UI primitives already include extensive accessibility features - need to verify not broken.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Verified Radix Dialog maintains focus trap
- ✅ Verified Radix Select keyboard navigation works (arrows, enter, esc)
- ✅ Verified Radix Dialog.Title and Dialog.Description properly linked
- ✅ Enhanced with additional ARIA labels where needed (complementing, not replacing)

#### Gotcha #2: Dark Mode Focus Indicators
**Issue**: Focus rings need proper offset in dark mode or they blend with dark backgrounds.

**Solution**:
- Added `focus:ring-offset-2 dark:focus:ring-offset-gray-900` to all focusable elements
- This creates a visible gap between element and focus ring in dark mode
- Tested visually to ensure focus is visible on both light and dark backgrounds

#### Gotcha #3: Dynamic Content Announcements
**Issue**: State changes (loading, errors) must be announced to screen readers.

**Solution**:
- Used `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical updates (loading states)
- Used `aria-live="assertive"` for critical errors (form validation, network errors)
- Added `role="status"` to loading spinners
- Added `role="alert"` to error containers

#### Gotcha #4: Decorative vs Functional Icons
**Issue**: Icons used for decoration should be hidden from screen readers.

**Solution**:
- All decorative icons (chevrons, checkmarks, folder icons) have `aria-hidden="true"`
- Functional icons (loading spinners) have `role="status"` and `aria-label`
- Text labels always present for screen reader users

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing:

#### Keyboard Navigation:
- [x] **Tab key**: Focus moves through all interactive elements in logical order
- [x] **Shift+Tab**: Focus moves backward through elements
- [x] **Enter**: Activates buttons and selects dropdown items
- [x] **Space**: Activates buttons and toggles dropdown
- [x] **Escape**: Closes modal (except during mutation)
- [x] **Arrow keys**: Navigate through project dropdown items
- [x] **Home/End**: Jump to first/last item in dropdown (Radix built-in)

#### Focus Indicators:
- [x] **All buttons**: Visible blue focus ring (2px, offset 2px)
- [x] **Form inputs**: Visible blue focus ring (2px)
- [x] **Dropdown trigger**: Visible blue focus ring (2px, offset 2px)
- [x] **Dropdown items**: Visible blue focus background
- [x] **Dark mode**: Focus indicators visible with proper offset

#### Screen Reader Testing (VoiceOver):
- [x] **EmptyProjectState**: "Empty project state, main, heading: No Projects Yet, Create your first project, button"
- [x] **ProjectSelector loading**: "Loading projects, status"
- [x] **ProjectSelector error**: "Alert: Failed to load projects, Retry loading projects, button"
- [x] **ProjectSelector trigger**: "Select project, button, listbox popup"
- [x] **Project items**: "Select project: Project Name, option"
- [x] **Create action**: "Create new project, option"
- [x] **Modal title**: "Create New Project, heading"
- [x] **Name input**: "Project Name, required, edit text"

#### Form Validation:
- [x] **Empty name**: Submit button disabled, `aria-invalid="false"` (not yet touched)
- [x] **Name entered then deleted**: `aria-invalid="true"`, validation prevents submit
- [x] **Valid name**: `aria-invalid="false"`, submit button enabled
- [x] **Server error**: Error announced immediately with `role="alert"`

### Validation Results:

#### Automated Checks:
```bash
# TypeScript check
