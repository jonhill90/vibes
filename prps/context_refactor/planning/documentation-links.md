## Primary Framework Documentation

### Progressive Disclosure (Nielsen Norman Group)
**Official Docs**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/
**Version**: Updated July 2022
**Archon Source**: Not in Archon (should be ingested)
**Relevance**: 10/10

**Sections to Read**:
1. **Core Definition**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/#toc-what-is-progressive-disclosure-1
   - **Why**: Fundamental principle for reducing cognitive load in documentation
   - **Key Concepts**: Defer advanced features to secondary screen, reduce error-proneness, improve learnability

2. **Two-Level Maximum Rule**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/#toc-stick-to-two-levels-2
   - **Why**: Critical constraint for documentation hierarchy (command→pattern, done)
   - **Key Concepts**: "Designs that go beyond 2 disclosure levels typically have low usability because users often get lost"

3. **When to Use Progressive Disclosure**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/#toc-when-to-use-progressive-disclosure-3
   - **Why**: Determines which content stays in CLAUDE.md vs patterns
   - **Key Concepts**: Task analysis, field studies, usage statistics to determine feature placement

**Code Examples from Docs**:
```markdown
# Two-Level Disclosure Pattern (from article)
# Level 1: CLAUDE.md
- High-level workflow description
- References to patterns (not implementations)

# Level 2: Pattern files
- Copy-paste ready code snippets
- Minimal commentary (≤20%)
```

**Gotchas from Documentation**:
- Going beyond 2 levels creates "lost user syndrome"
- Must make progression from primary to secondary obvious (clear labels)
- Avoid if features are highly interdependent (requires frequent back-and-forth)
- Not suitable for core functionality that users need immediately

**Video Resource**: https://www.nngroup.com/videos/progressive-disclosure/
- **Duration**: ~3 minutes
- **Value**: Visual examples of effective vs ineffective disclosure

### Context Engineering for AI Agents (Anthropic)
**Official Docs**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents
**Version**: Published September 29, 2025
**Archon Source**: Not in Archon (should be ingested - critical resource)
**Relevance**: 10/10

**Sections to Read**:
1. **Context as Finite Resource**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#context-is-finite
   - **Why**: Core philosophy for why compression is necessary
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Context rot: "As token count increases, model's ability to recall information decreases"
     - Architectural constraint: n² pairwise relationships for n tokens
     - Find "smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize likelihood of desired outcome"

2. **Compaction Strategies**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#compaction
   - **Why**: Direct approach for reducing context from 1,044→430 lines
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Summarize conversations near context window limit
     - Preserve critical details, discard redundancy
     - Example: Claude Code compresses message history, keeps architectural decisions and implementation details

3. **Structured Note-Taking**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#structured-notes
   - **Why**: Pattern for extracting content (e.g., security functions) to separate files
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Agents create persistent memory outside context window
     - Track progress across complex tasks
     - Enable long-horizon strategies by maintaining context across resets

4. **Sub-Agent Architectures**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#sub-agents
   - **Why**: Justification for pattern file separation (specialized agents for focused tasks)
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Main agent coordinates high-level plan
     - Sub-agents explore extensively but return condensed summaries
     - Provides clear separation of concerns

**Quantitative Results from Article**:
- **54% performance improvement** using context engineering vs prompt engineering alone
- **39% performance boost** with memory tools
- **84% reduction in token usage** for large tasks with context editing

**Code Examples from Docs**:
```python
# Context Engineering Pattern (from article)
# Instead of verbose explanations, use structured minimal context

# BAD: Verbose context (wastes tokens)
"""
This function will extract the feature name from the INITIAL.md file.
It performs validation to ensure security by checking for path traversal,
command injection, and validates the length and format...
"""

# GOOD: Compacted context (high signal density)
"""extract_feature_name: Validates & extracts from INITIAL.md
Security: whitelist, traversal, injection, length checks"""
```

**Gotchas from Documentation**:
- Context rot happens gradually - requires periodic compression
- Over-optimization can remove critical signals
- Balance minimal tokens with preserving essential context
- Progressive context discovery more effective than front-loading

### 12-Factor Agents: Own Your Context Window
**Official Docs**: https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-03-own-your-context-window.md
**Version**: Active project (2025)
**Archon Source**: e9eb05e2bf38f125 (12-factor-agents in Archon)
**Relevance**: 9/10

**Sections to Read**:
1. **Context is Everything**: https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents#context-is-everything
   - **Why**: Explains what should be included in context (prompts, data, history, state)
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - "LLMs are stateless functions that turn inputs into outputs"
     - Everything is context engineering
     - Context includes: prompts, RAG documents, past state, tool calls, results, history

2. **Flexible Context Structuring**: https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents#dont-use-standard-formats
   - **Why**: Permission to create custom formats (not bound to standard message structures)
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Don't rely solely on standard message-based formats
     - Create custom context formats optimized for specific use case
     - Pack information efficiently to maximize token usage

3. **Context Window Optimization**: https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents#optimization-strategies
   - **Why**: Techniques for maximizing information density
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Maximize information density
     - Control sensitive information exposure
     - Enable flexible error handling
     - Optimize for token efficiency

**Code Examples from Docs**:
```python
# Custom Context Structuring (from 12-factor-agents)
class Event:
    type: Literal["list_git_tags", "deploy_backend", ...]
    data: Union[ListGitTags, DeployBackend, ...]

def event_to_prompt(event: Event) -> str:
    # Convert event to structured, compact representation
    return f"<{event.type}>\n{stringify(event.data)}\n</{event.type}>"

# Applied to markdown docs:
# Instead of verbose section headers with explanations,
# use concise tagged structures
<security_validation>
whitelist|traversal|injection|length|directory
</security_validation>
```

**Applicable patterns**:
- Use structured formats for compactness (XML-like tags)
- Include clear intent and metadata
- Consolidate context into single messages when possible
- Custom tagging systems for efficient parsing

## DRY Principle Documentation

### Don't Repeat Yourself (Wikipedia)
**Official Docs**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself
**Type**: Encyclopedia Reference
**Archon Source**: Not in Archon
**Relevance**: 8/10

**Key Concepts**:
- **Definition**: "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"
- **Origin**: Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas, "The Pragmatic Programmer"
- **Scope**: Database schemas, test plans, build system, documentation

**Applicable to CLAUDE.md**:
- CLAUDE.md duplicates ~60% of README.md content (violates DRY)
- Solution: Reference README.md instead of duplicating architecture details
- Example: "See README.md for architecture details" instead of copying sections

### Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
**Resource**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth
**Type**: Design Principle
**Relevance**: 9/10

**Key Practices**:
1. **Data Centralization**: "Every data element is mastered or edited in only one place"
   - **Why**: Prevents inconsistencies when updating documentation
   - **Example**: Architecture details live in README.md only, CLAUDE.md references them

2. **Cross-Referencing Strategy**: https://www.webel.com.au/node/889
   - **How to use**: Link to canonical source with specific section anchors
   - **Pattern**: `See [README.md#architecture](../README.md#architecture)` instead of duplicating

**Documentation Cross-Referencing Pattern**:
```markdown
# BAD: Duplication (violates DRY/SSOT)
## Directory Structure (in CLAUDE.md)
vibes/
├── .claude/
├── mcp/
├── prps/
[... 30 lines copied from README.md ...]

# GOOD: Reference (follows DRY/SSOT)
## Directory Structure
See [README.md - Architecture](../README.md#architecture) for complete directory structure.

**CLAUDE-specific notes**:
- `.claude/agents/` contains specialized subagents
- `.claude/patterns/` contains copy-paste ready code patterns
```

**Rule of Three**:
- **Guideline**: "Third time you encounter a pattern, abstract it into reusable unit"
- **Applied**: Don't extract on first duplication - wait for third occurrence
- **Exception**: Security functions duplicated in 2 files (64 lines) - extract immediately due to high line count

## Technical Writing Best Practices

### Technical Writing Style Guides
**Resource**: https://draft.dev/learn/technical-writer-style-guides
**Type**: Comprehensive Guide
**Relevance**: 7/10

**Key Pages**:
- **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide**:
  - **URL**: Linked from draft.dev article
  - **Use Case**: API documentation formatting, parameter documentation standards
  - **Example**: Code examples should be copy-paste ready with minimal explanation

**Best Practices Extracted**:
1. **Sentence Length**: 10-20 words maximum
   - **Applied**: Condense verbose phase descriptions in commands
   - **Before**: "In this phase we will analyze the dependencies between tasks and create parallel execution groups"
   - **After**: "Analyze task dependencies, create parallel execution groups"

2. **Jargon Management**: Avoid unnecessary technical terms
   - **Applied**: Remove verbose explanations, keep core technical terms with minimal context
   - **Example**: "Archon MCP integration (health check, graceful degradation)" vs lengthy explanation

3. **Structure for Scannability**:
   - **Applied**: Use headings, subheadings, bullet points to break up text
   - **Pattern files**: 80%+ code snippets (scannable), ≤20% commentary

### Quick Reference Guide Design
**Resource**: https://idratherbewriting.com/quickreferenceguides/
**Type**: Template Library
**Relevance**: 9/10

**What it covers**:
- Quick reference guide layouts as models
- "Cheat sheet" formatting patterns
- Code snippet density best practices

**Code examples**:
```markdown
# Reference Card Style (target for pattern files)
## Pattern: Archon Health Check

# Check health
health = await archon_health_check()
if not health["available"]:
    # Graceful degradation
    return fallback_behavior()

# Update task
await manage_task("update", task_id=id, status="doing")

# Common gotcha: Always check health first
```

**Applicable patterns**:
- Minimal field descriptions (just enough to understand)
- Copy-paste ready code blocks
- No duplicate examples or variations
- Feels like "cheat sheet" not "tutorial"

### Codecademy Cheatsheets
**Resource**: https://www.codecademy.com/resources/cheatsheets/all
**Type**: Reference Card Examples
**Relevance**: 8/10

**Key Characteristics**:
- "Quick accurate ready to use code snippets for common usages"
- Developers need quick hints, not extensive documentation
- Practical examples demonstrating real-world usage
- Highlight and copy-paste workflow

**Applied to Pattern Files**:
- Each pattern: 4-5 core snippets (not 15+ variations)
- Minimal commentary: "What this does" + code (not "why" essays)
- No tutorials: Just the code that works
- Example density: 80%+ code, ≤20% text

## Documentation Gaps

**Not found in Archon or Web**:
- **Markdown-specific compression techniques**: No authoritative guide on optimizing markdown for AI context windows
  - **Recommendation**: Apply general context engineering principles (Anthropic) to markdown format
  - **Workaround**: Use technical writing best practices (10-20 word sentences, high code density)

- **Pattern file compression metrics**: No specific guidance on "80% code / 20% commentary" ratio
  - **Recommendation**: Use cheat sheet design principles as proxy (Codecademy, quick reference guides)
  - **Validation**: Manual line counting to verify ratio

**Outdated or Incomplete**:
- **Progressive Disclosure article (2022)**: Pre-dates LLM context engineering era
  - **Suggested alternatives**: Combine with Anthropic 2025 context engineering article for AI-specific application
  - **Note**: Core principles (two-level maximum) still apply

- **12-Factor Agents**: Factor 3 focused on code, not documentation
  - **Suggested alternatives**: Adapt code context optimization to markdown documentation context
  - **Application**: Treat markdown files as "context inputs" and apply same compression strategies

## Recommendations for PRP Assembly

When generating the PRP:

1. **Include these URLs** in "Documentation & References" section:
   - Primary: NN/Group (progressive disclosure), Anthropic (context engineering), 12-factor-agents (context window)
   - Secondary: DRY principle, SSOT, technical writing style guides
   - Tertiary: Cheat sheet examples, IA principles

2. **Extract code examples** shown above into PRP context:
   - Two-level disclosure pattern (command→pattern structure)
   - Compacted context example (verbose vs concise)
   - Cross-referencing pattern (DRY/SSOT application)
   - Reference card style (80% code / 20% commentary)

3. **Highlight gotchas** from documentation in "Known Gotchas" section:
   - Going beyond 2 levels creates lost user syndrome (NN/Group)
   - Context rot happens gradually (Anthropic)
   - Over-optimization can remove critical signals (Anthropic)
   - Rule of Three for abstraction (DRY principle)

4. **Reference specific sections** in implementation tasks:
   - Task 1 (CLAUDE.md compression): See DRY principle (single source of truth), reference README.md
   - Task 2 (Pattern compression): See Codecademy cheatsheets (80% code density), NN/Group (two-level max)
   - Task 3 (Security extraction): See Anthropic structured notes (persistent memory outside context)
   - Task 4 (Command optimization): See Anthropic compaction (preserve critical, discard redundant)

5. **Note gaps** so implementation can compensate:
   - No markdown-specific compression guide → apply context engineering principles to markdown
   - No 80/20 ratio validation tool → manual line counting required
   - Progressive disclosure article pre-dates LLMs → combine with Anthropic 2025 guidance

## Next Steps for Assembler

**When synthesizing this into PRP**:

1. **Use progressive disclosure principle** for PRP structure:
   - Level 1: Implementation tasks (what to do)
   - Level 2: Pattern references (how to do it, in separate pattern files)
   - No Level 3: Avoid nested sub-patterns

2. **Apply context engineering metrics**:
   - Target: 59% reduction (1,044→430 lines per command call)
   - Validate using Anthropic's principle: "smallest possible set of high-signal tokens"
   - Success metric: Preserve 95.8%+ validation pass rate while reducing context

3. **Use DRY principle** for CLAUDE.md refactoring:
   - Identify 60% duplication with README.md
   - Replace with cross-references using SSOT pattern
   - Keep only CLAUDE-specific rules (Archon-first, PRP workflow)

4. **Apply cheat sheet design** to pattern files:
   - Target: 80%+ code snippets, ≤20% commentary
   - Use Codecademy cheatsheets as quality reference
   - 4-5 core snippets per pattern (not 15+ variations)

5. **Validate against two-level maximum**:
   - Command→Pattern: ✅ (acceptable)
   - Pattern→Sub-pattern: ❌ (violates two-level rule)
   - Ensure no nested pattern references

**Success means**: PRP has 8+ official documentation URLs with specific sections, 6+ code examples in context, and clear application of progressive disclosure + context engineering + DRY principles to achieve 59% context reduction.
