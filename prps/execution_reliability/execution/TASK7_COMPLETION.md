## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Report Coverage Calculation in Phase 5
Added metrics calculation before displaying completion summary:
```python
# Calculate report coverage metrics
metrics = calculate_report_coverage(feature_name, total_tasks)
```

#### 2. Quality Gate Enforcement
Added validation that fails execution if report coverage < 100%:
```python
# Quality gate: Enforce 100% report coverage
if metrics['coverage_percentage'] < 100:
    raise ValidationError(
        f"Quality Gate FAILED: Report coverage {metrics['coverage_percentage']}% (required: 100%)\n"
        f"Missing reports for tasks: {metrics['missing_tasks']}"
    )
```

#### 3. Enhanced Success Summary
Modified success output to display:
- Implementation: X/X tasks (100%)
- Documentation: X/X reports (X%)
- Status indicator (✅ COMPLETE or ⚠️ with missing task list)
- Added step 4 in "Next Steps": Review task reports

#### 4. Enhanced Partial Implementation Summary
Modified partial output to display:
- Documentation metrics (reports_found/total_tasks)
- Missing tasks warning if coverage < 100%
- Added action item to generate missing reports

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Silent Documentation Failures
**From PRP**: "48% report coverage in task_management_ui - execution continues despite missing documentation"

**Implementation**:
- Added quality gate that raises `ValidationError` if coverage < 100%
- Execution will HALT, not continue silently
- Follows fail-fast pattern from PRP Known Gotchas #5

#### Gotcha #2: Vague Error Messages
**From PRP**: "Error messages must be actionable (Problem → Impact → Troubleshooting → Resolution)"

**Implementation**:
- Error message clearly states coverage percentage and requirement
- Lists specific missing task numbers: `Missing reports for tasks: [3, 5, 7]`
- Follows format_missing_report_error() pattern from Task 4

#### Gotcha #3: Template Variable Formatting
**From PRP**: "Use .format(**variables) for runtime template substitution"

**Implementation**:
- Used f-strings within Python code blocks (correct for pseudocode)
- Display templates use variable interpolation syntax: `{metrics['coverage_percentage']}`
- Conditional display using ternary operators for status messages

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 4**: calculate_report_coverage() function exists in execute-prp.md Phase 0 (line 155)
  - Verified function signature matches expected usage
  - Function returns dict with: total_tasks, reports_found, coverage_percentage, missing_tasks, status
  - No modifications needed to Task 4 implementation

### External Dependencies:
None - Uses existing Python stdlib and functions already in execute-prp.md

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Post-Implementation):
- [ ] Execute a PRP with 100% report coverage
  - Verify success summary displays "Documentation: X/X reports (100%)"
  - Verify status shows "✅ COMPLETE"
  - Verify no quality gate error raised

- [ ] Execute a PRP with missing reports (or simulate)
  - Verify quality gate raises ValidationError
  - Verify error message shows coverage percentage
  - Verify error message lists specific missing task numbers
  - Verify execution halts (fail-fast)

- [ ] Check partial implementation summary
  - Verify documentation metrics displayed
  - Verify missing tasks shown if coverage < 100%
  - Verify action item includes missing task numbers

### Validation Results:
- ✅ Code is syntactically valid Python (within markdown code blocks)
- ✅ Follows pattern from PRP Task 7 specification
- ✅ Uses calculate_report_coverage() from Task 4 correctly
- ✅ Quality gate matches ValidationError pattern from Phase 0
- ✅ Error messages are actionable (state problem + missing tasks)
- ✅ Display format is clear and visually distinct (separator lines)

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:
- [x] Coverage metrics displayed in final summary (success case)
- [x] Coverage metrics displayed in partial summary
- [x] Missing tasks shown if <100% coverage
- [x] Quality gate enforces 100% coverage (raises ValidationError)
- [x] Summary formatting is clear and readable
- [x] Uses calculate_report_coverage() from Task 4
- [x] Code is syntactically valid Python

**Code Quality**:
- Clear separation of concerns (metrics calculation → validation → display)
- Follows existing execute-prp.md patterns (ValidationError, quality gates)
- Actionable error messages with specific missing task numbers
- Visual separators for readability (='*80 borders)
- Comprehensive next steps including review of task reports
- Conditional display using ternary operators (clean, readable)

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Quality Gate Placement
**Context**: Where to enforce 100% coverage requirement?

**Options Considered**:
1. Warn only (allow execution to continue)
2. Enforce in Phase 5 before displaying summary
3. Enforce after each task group in Phase 2

**Decision**: Option 2 - Enforce in Phase 5 before displaying summary

**Reasoning**:
- Phase 2 already has per-group validation (added in Task 5)
- Phase 5 is final quality gate before marking PRP complete
- Fail-fast at end prevents claiming "complete" with missing docs
- Follows PRP pattern: "Quality gate to fail if coverage <100%"

### Decision 2: Display Format
**Context**: How to show coverage metrics in summary?

**Options Considered**:
1. Single line: "Reports: X/X (Y%)"
2. Separate line with label: "Documentation: X/X reports (Y%)"
3. Combined with implementation metrics

**Decision**: Option 2 - Separate labeled line

**Reasoning**:
- Clear distinction between implementation and documentation
- Consistent with task completion format: "Implementation: X/X tasks"
- Easier to scan visually
- Matches PRP specification example format

### Decision 3: Missing Tasks Display
**Context**: How to show which tasks are missing reports?

**Options Considered**:
1. Show count only: "⚠️ 3 reports missing"
2. Show task numbers: "⚠️ Missing reports for tasks: [3, 5, 7]"
3. Show detailed table with task names

**Decision**: Option 2 - Show task numbers in list format

**Reasoning**:
- Specific and actionable (user knows exactly which tasks)
- Concise (doesn't bloat summary with large table)
- Follows pattern from calculate_report_coverage() return value
- Easy to parse programmatically if needed

### Decision 4: Conditional Status Display
**Context**: How to handle status message when coverage varies?

**Options Considered**:
1. Always show status emoji (✅/⚠️)
2. Conditionally show missing tasks or success message
3. Separate fields for status and missing tasks

**Decision**: Option 2 - Ternary operator for conditional display

**Reasoning**:
- Clean, single-line conditional in template
- Shows relevant info (status if 100%, missing tasks if not)
- Avoids redundancy (don't need both status and missing list)
- Pythonic and readable

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Template String Escaping
**Issue**: Initial attempt used `"="*80` which didn't render correctly in markdown code blocks

**Solution**: Changed to `{'='*80}` to indicate Python expression evaluation

**Learning**: Markdown code blocks need clear expression syntax for dynamic content

### Challenge 2: Balancing Detail vs. Brevity
**Issue**: Success/partial summaries getting verbose with all metrics

**Solution**: Used visual separators (borders) and structured sections with clear labels

**Learning**: Well-formatted output is easier to scan than dense paragraphs

### Challenge 3: Quality Gate Timing
**Issue**: Considered whether to fail fast in Phase 5 or allow partial completion

**Solution**: Decided to raise ValidationError in Phase 5 to enforce 100% coverage

**Learning**: Quality gates are only effective if they block progression (fail-fast principle)

## Notes

### Pattern Followed
This implementation closely follows the PRP specification for Task 7:
- Used calculate_report_coverage() function from Task 4 (line 155 in execute-prp.md)
- Added quality gate with ValidationError for <100% coverage
- Enhanced both success and partial summaries with documentation metrics
- Displayed missing tasks when coverage <100%
- Added actionable next steps for reviewing task reports

### Integration Points
- **Phase 0**: Uses calculate_report_coverage() and ValidationError class
- **Phase 2**: Complements per-group validation (added in Task 5)
- **Phase 5**: Final quality gate before marking PRP complete

### Future Enhancements
- Could add report quality validation (check required sections)
- Could generate summary statistics across all task reports
- Could add report coverage to Archon project metadata

**Task 7 implementation complete and ready for validation.**
