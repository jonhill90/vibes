## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Comparison Table with Weighted Scoring

Created comprehensive comparison across 5 criteria:
- **Deployment Complexity**: 1-10 scale (lower = simpler)
- **Performance**: Latency benchmarks for 1M vectors
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Metadata query support
- **Memory Footprint**: RAM requirements for 1M 1536-dim vectors
- **Production Maturity**: Community, docs, enterprise adoption

**Weighted Scoring Results**:
- Qdrant: 8.05/10 (PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION)
- Weaviate: 7.45/10
- Milvus: 5.95/10
- pgvector: 5.30/10 (ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION)

#### 2. Decision Rationale

**Primary Recommendation: Qdrant**

Key reasons (3 paragraphs as required):

1. **Optimal Balance**: Qdrant provides 2-3x better performance than pgvector (10-30ms vs 50-100ms) while maintaining deployment simplicity comparable to a single Docker container. For RAG services, low-latency retrieval directly impacts user experience.

2. **Async Python Native**: The RAG service uses FastAPI (async framework). Qdrant's `AsyncQdrantClient` prevents blocking the event loop, crucial for handling concurrent requests efficiently. Weaviate and Milvus lack mature async Python clients.

3. **Right-Sized for RAG**: RAG services typically manage 100K-10M vectors. Qdrant excels at this scale without operational overhead of Milvus or resource consumption of Weaviate.

**Alternative Recommendation: pgvector**

When to use instead:
- PostgreSQL-centric teams (deep expertise)
- Tight integration with relational data
- Small scale (<1M vectors, <10 QPS)
- Budget constraints (no separate DB instance needed)

#### 3. Docker Setup for Chosen Database

Provided production-ready Docker Compose configuration for Qdrant:
- Health checks
- Volume mounting for persistence (with SELinux compatibility)
- Resource limits
- Environment variables for configuration
- Restart policies

**Complete snippet** (as required):
```yaml
qdrant:
  image: qdrant/qdrant:v1.7.4
  ports: [6333, 6334]
  volumes:
    - qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z  # Persistence + SELinux
  environment:
    QDRANT__SERVICE__GRPC_PORT: 6334
    QDRANT__LOG_LEVEL: INFO
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:6333/healthz"]
    interval: 30s
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 4G
```

#### 4. Critical Gotchas Documented

**Qdrant Gotchas** (3 documented with solutions):

1. **Volume Mounting**: Persistent storage requires `:z` suffix for SELinux compatibility
2. **Distance Metrics**: Must be consistent between collection creation and search
3. **AsyncQdrantClient**: Requires qdrant-client >= 1.6.1 for async support

**pgvector Gotchas** (2 documented with solutions):

1. **Index Timing**: HNSW indexes MUST be created AFTER bulk inserts (10x faster)
2. **Index Type Selection**: IVFFlat vs HNSW trade-offs (memory, performance)

All gotchas include:
- Problem description
- Why it matters
- ❌ Wrong approach (code example)
- ✅ Right approach (code example)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### From PRP Planning Gotchas

**Gotcha #5: Qdrant Dimension Mismatch** (from prp gotchas.md:458-500)
- **Implementation**: Documented importance of matching vector dimensions between collection config and embedding model
- **Solution**: Recommended dimension validation before inserts, config-driven setup

**Pattern from Examples** (examples/README.md):
- Followed service layer pattern principles (clean separation, error handling)
- Applied configuration-driven feature enablement (from rag_service.py pattern)

#### Database-Specific Gotchas

**Addressed in Evaluation**:
1. Qdrant volume persistence (prevents data loss on restarts)
2. Qdrant distance metric consistency (prevents invalid results)
3. pgvector index creation timing (prevents 10x slowdown)
4. pgvector ANALYZE requirement (prevents slow queries due to bad query plans)
