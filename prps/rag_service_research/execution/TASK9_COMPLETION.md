## Patterns Followed

### From PRP Requirements
✅ Mock asyncpg connection pool with AsyncMock
✅ Test service methods independently
✅ Verify tuple[bool, dict] return values
✅ Test all error handling paths
✅ Target 80% code coverage
✅ FastAPI TestClient for API routes
✅ MCP tool JSON string validation
✅ Truncation and optimization tests
✅ Load test with 100 concurrent requests
✅ Latency percentiles measurement
✅ Sample documents with known embeddings
✅ Separate test database configuration
✅ CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

### From task-manager Examples
✅ Service layer testing patterns (01_service_layer_pattern.py)
✅ MCP tool testing patterns (02_mcp_consolidated_tools.py)
✅ FastAPI endpoint testing (07_fastapi_endpoint_pattern.py)
✅ Transaction testing patterns (06_transaction_pattern.py)

### Gotchas Addressed
✅ **Gotcha #8**: Always use async context managers (test connection cleanup)
✅ **Gotcha #6**: MCP tools must return JSON strings (validation tests)
✅ **Gotcha #7**: Truncate large fields for MCP (truncation tests)
✅ **Gotcha #2**: Connection pool deadlock prevention (load testing)
✅ **Gotcha #3**: asyncpg $1, $2 placeholders (test SQL patterns)
