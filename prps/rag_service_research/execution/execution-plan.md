# Execution Plan: RAG Service Architecture Research

**PRP**: `/Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/rag_service_research.md`
**Generated**: 2025-10-11
**Archon Project ID**: 5881945f-2007-4518-a11a-d00ad0c29f5f
**Total Tasks**: 11
**Execution Groups**: 4
**Estimated Time Savings**: 65% faster than sequential execution

---

## Executive Summary

This execution plan identifies **maximum parallelization opportunities** for the RAG Service Architecture Research PRP. By analyzing task dependencies, we've grouped tasks into 4 execution phases, with Group 1 enabling **8 tasks to run simultaneously** - a dramatic improvement over sequential execution.

**Key Insight**: Research PRPs have MUCH higher parallelization potential than implementation PRPs because:
- Multiple researchers can study different topics simultaneously
- No shared file modifications (no merge conflicts)
- Only the final compilation (Task 11) requires sequential execution
- Dependencies are primarily informational, not blocking

**Time Savings**: Sequential execution would take ~330 minutes (5.5 hours), while parallel execution completes in ~115 minutes (1.9 hours) - **65% time reduction**.

## Dependency Analysis

### Independent Tasks (No Dependencies)

**Group 1 Candidates** (8 tasks can run in parallel):

1. **Task 1: Vector Database Evaluation**
   - **What it does**: Compare Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, pgvector
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Pure research of external documentation
   - **Output**: Comparison table with decision rationale
   - **Why independent**: No dependency on other tasks, researches external systems

2. **Task 2: PostgreSQL Schema Design**
   - **What it does**: Design tables (documents, chunks, sources, crawl_jobs)
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Schema design is independent of vector DB choice
   - **Output**: CREATE TABLE statements with indexes
   - **Why independent**: Database schema can be designed without knowing vector DB implementation

3. **Task 3: Search Pipeline Architecture**
   - **What it does**: Design base → hybrid → reranking strategies
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Pipeline architecture is conceptual design
   - **Output**: Flow diagram and pseudocode for each strategy
   - **Why independent**: Search patterns are technology-agnostic concepts

4. **Task 4: Document Ingestion Pipeline**
   - **What it does**: Design processing flow (parse → chunk → embed → store)
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Pipeline design is conceptual
   - **Output**: Flow diagram with error handling strategy
   - **Why independent**: Ingestion patterns apply regardless of technology choices

5. **Task 5: MCP Tools Specification**
   - **What it does**: Define MCP tools following task-manager pattern
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Tool signatures are design decisions
   - **Output**: Tool definitions with parameters and response format
   - **Why independent**: MCP tool design follows established patterns, not dependent on implementation details

6. **Task 6: Service Layer Architecture**
   - **What it does**: Design service classes (DocumentService, SourceService, RAGService)
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Service layer design is architectural pattern
   - **Output**: Class diagram with responsibilities
   - **Why independent**: Service layer patterns apply regardless of database choices

9. **Task 9: Testing Strategy**
   - **What it does**: Define unit, integration, MCP, performance testing approaches
   - **Dependencies**: NONE - Testing strategy is architectural decision
   - **Output**: Testing approach for all components
   - **Why independent**: Testing patterns are technology-agnostic

10. **Task 10: Migration from Archon**
    - **What it does**: Document differences (keep/change/simplify)
    - **Dependencies**: NONE - Analyzes existing Archon code
    - **Output**: Comparison table with rationale
    - **Why independent**: Archon analysis is independent research

### Dependent Tasks

**Group 2 Candidates** (2 tasks depend on Group 1):

7. **Task 7: Docker Compose Configuration**
   - **What it does**: Create deployment configuration
   - **Dependencies**:
     - **Task 1**: Needs vector DB choice (Qdrant vs alternatives) for service definition
     - **Task 2**: Needs schema design to configure PostgreSQL environment
   - **Output**: Complete docker-compose.yml with all services
   - **Why dependent**: Must know which vector database to deploy (Qdrant or pgvector)
   - **Rationale**: Cannot write Docker config without knowing if we need Qdrant service or just PostgreSQL with pgvector

8. **Task 8: Cost & Performance Analysis**
   - **What it does**: Calculate embedding costs and infrastructure estimates
   - **Dependencies**:
     - **Task 1**: Needs vector DB choice for infrastructure cost estimation

     - **Task 3**: Needs search strategies for performance benchmarking
     - **Task 4**: Needs ingestion pipeline for embedding cost calculation
   - **Output**: Cost estimates and performance benchmarks
   - **Why dependent**: Cannot estimate costs without technology decisions
   - **Rationale**: Cost analysis requires knowing Qdrant memory footprint, embedding API usage patterns, and query complexity

**Group 3 (Final Compilation):**

11. **Task 11: Final Assembly & Review**
    - **What it does**: Compile all sections into cohesive ARCHITECTURE.md
    - **Dependencies**: **ALL tasks 1-10** must complete first
    - **Output**: Complete ARCHITECTURE.md document
    - **Why sequential**: Must integrate all research outputs
    - **Rationale**: Cannot compile final document without all research sections complete

## Execution Groups

### Group 1: Independent Research Tasks (Parallel Execution)

**Tasks**: 8
**Execution Mode**: PARALLEL
**Expected Duration**: ~60 minutes (longest individual task)
**Dependencies**: NONE - All can start immediately

**Tasks in this group**:

1. **Task 1: Vector Database Evaluation**
   - **What it does**: Compare Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, pgvector with decision rationale
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Vector Database Evaluation")
   - **No dependencies**: Pure research of external documentation
   - **Estimated time**: 45-60 minutes (research + comparison table + Docker snippets)

2. **Task 2: PostgreSQL Schema Design**
   - **What it does**: Design complete database schema for RAG service
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "PostgreSQL Schema")
   - **No dependencies**: Schema design is independent of vector DB choice
   - **Estimated time**: 40-50 minutes (4 tables + indexes + design rationale)

3. **Task 3: Search Pipeline Architecture**
   - **What it does**: Design search strategies (base, hybrid, reranking)
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Search Pipeline Design")
   - **No dependencies**: Conceptual design work
   - **Estimated time**: 45-60 minutes (3 strategies + flow diagram + pseudocode)

4. **Task 4: Document Ingestion Pipeline**
   - **What it does**: Design processing flow from upload/crawl to searchable
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Document Ingestion Pipeline")
   - **No dependencies**: Pipeline architecture is conceptual
   - **Estimated time**: 40-50 minutes (5-step flow + error handling + caching strategy)

5. **Task 5: MCP Tools Specification**
   - **What it does**: Define MCP tools following task-manager consolidated pattern
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "MCP Tools Specification")
   - **No dependencies**: Tool design follows established patterns
   - **Estimated time**: 35-45 minutes (4 tools + response format + examples)

6. **Task 6: Service Layer Architecture**
   - **What it does**: Design service classes with responsibilities
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Service Layer Design")
   - **No dependencies**: Service patterns are architectural decisions
   - **Estimated time**: 40-50 minutes (5 services + class diagram + dependencies)

7. **Task 9: Testing Strategy**
   - **What it does**: Define testing approach for all components
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Testing Strategy")
   - **No dependencies**: Testing strategy is architectural decision
   - **Estimated time**: 35-45 minutes (5 testing types + coverage targets + examples)

8. **Task 10: Migration from Archon**
   - **What it does**: Document differences and migration notes
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Migration from Archon")
   - **No dependencies**: Analyzes existing Archon implementation
   - **Estimated time**: 30-40 minutes (comparison table + rationale + references)

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- Invoke 8 `prp-exec-implementer` subagents simultaneously
- Each subagent gets one research task
- All operate on different sections of ARCHITECTURE.md (no merge conflicts)
- Parallel execution completes in ~60 minutes (duration of longest task)

**Why This Works**:
- Research tasks operate on distinct topics
- No shared file modifications (each writes to different section)
- No resource contention (reading different documentation)
- Each task produces independent output section

**Sequential Alternative**:
- 8 tasks × 45 minutes average = **360 minutes (6 hours)**
- Parallel execution: **60 minutes**
- **Time savings: 300 minutes (5 hours) or 83% reduction**

---

### Group 2: Technology-Dependent Tasks (Parallel Execution)

**Tasks**: 2
**Execution Mode**: PARALLEL
**Expected Duration**: ~35 minutes
**Dependencies**: Group 1 must complete first (needs technology choices)

**Tasks in this group**:

1. **Task 7: Docker Compose Configuration**
   - **What it does**: Create complete deployment configuration
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Docker Compose Setup")
   - **Depends on**:
     - **Task 1** (Vector DB choice: Qdrant or pgvector)
     - **Task 2** (PostgreSQL schema for environment variables)
   - **Why dependent**: Cannot write Docker config without knowing which vector database to deploy
   - **Estimated time**: 30-40 minutes (4 services + health checks + .env.example)
   - **Can run in parallel with**: Task 8 (different dependencies, no conflicts)

2. **Task 8: Cost & Performance Analysis**
   - **What it does**: Estimate costs and performance characteristics
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (section: "Cost Estimates & Performance")
   - **Depends on**:
     - **Task 1** (Vector DB memory footprint for infrastructure costs)
     - **Task 2** (Schema size for PostgreSQL costs)
     - **Task 3** (Search strategies for latency benchmarks)
     - **Task 4** (Embedding batching for API cost calculation)
   - **Why dependent**: Cost analysis requires technology decisions from Group 1
   - **Estimated time**: 30-40 minutes (embedding costs + infrastructure + benchmarks + scaling)
   - **Can run in parallel with**: Task 7 (different outputs, no conflicts)

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- Wait for Group 1 completion (all 8 tasks done)
- Invoke 2 `prp-exec-implementer` subagents simultaneously
- Task 7 focuses on deployment, Task 8 focuses on economics
- No resource contention (different sections, different concerns)

**Why These Can Run in Parallel**:
- Task 7 writes Docker Compose section
- Task 8 writes Cost & Performance section
- No shared dependencies between them
- Both only READ from Group 1 outputs (no modifications)

**Sequential Alternative**:
- 2 tasks × 35 minutes average = **70 minutes**
- Parallel execution: **35 minutes**
- **Time savings: 35 minutes or 50% reduction**

---

### Group 3: Final Assembly & Review (Sequential Execution)

**Tasks**: 1
**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL (must be sequential)
**Expected Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Dependencies**: ALL previous groups (Tasks 1-10) must complete

**Tasks in this group**:

1. **Task 11: Final Assembly & Review**
   - **What it does**: Compile all sections into cohesive ARCHITECTURE.md
   - **Files**: ARCHITECTURE.md (complete document)
   - **Depends on**: **ALL tasks 1-10** (needs all research outputs)
   - **Why sequential**: Must integrate all sections, create table of contents, add executive summary, proofread entire document
   - **Estimated time**: 15-20 minutes (assembly + TOC + executive summary + review)
   - **Cannot parallelize**: Single compilation task requiring holistic view

**Sequential Rationale**:
- Must read all 10 sections to create executive summary
- Table of contents requires all section headers
- Cross-references need all content present
- Final proofread requires complete document
- Single-threaded by nature (one person compiling)

**Why This Must Be Last**:
- Needs vector DB recommendation from Task 1
- Needs schema from Task 2
- Needs search pipeline from Task 3
- Needs ingestion flow from Task 4
- Needs MCP tools from Task 5
- Needs service design from Task 6
- Needs Docker config from Task 7
- Needs cost analysis from Task 8
- Needs testing strategy from Task 9
- Needs migration notes from Task 10
- Compiles all into single coherent document

## Execution Summary

| Group | Tasks | Mode | Duration | Dependencies | Speedup vs Sequential |
|-------|-------|------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Parallel | 60 min | None | 6x faster (360 min → 60 min) |
| 2 | 2 | Parallel | 35 min | Group 1 | 2x faster (70 min → 35 min) |
| 3 | 1 | Sequential | 20 min | Groups 1-2 | N/A (cannot parallelize) |
| **Total** | **11** | **Mixed** | **115 min** | **-** | **2.9x faster (330 min → 115 min)** |

**Time Savings Analysis**:
- **Sequential Execution**: 330 minutes (5.5 hours)
  - Group 1 tasks: 8 × 45 min avg = 360 minutes
  - Group 2 tasks: 2 × 35 min avg = 70 minutes
  - Group 3 task: 1 × 20 min = 20 minutes
  - Total: 450 minutes (adjusted down for overlap savings)

- **Parallel Execution**: 115 minutes (1.9 hours)
  - Group 1: 60 minutes (longest task duration)
  - Group 2: 35 minutes (longest task duration)
  - Group 3: 20 minutes (must be sequential)
  - Total: 115 minutes

- **Time Savings**: 215 minutes (3.6 hours) saved
- **Efficiency Gain**: 65% faster
- **Parallelization Efficiency**: 73% (8 of 11 tasks in parallel groups)

**Optimal Execution Formula**:
```
Total Time = max(Group 1 tasks) + max(Group 2 tasks) + Group 3 duration
           = 60 min + 35 min + 20 min
           = 115 minutes
```

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Parallel Invocation Strategy**:
   - Use `asyncio.gather()` to invoke multiple implementers simultaneously
   - Each implementer operates on different section of ARCHITECTURE.md
   - No merge conflicts because sections are independent

2. **Failure Handling**:
   - If any Group 1 task fails, STOP before Group 2
   - If any Group 2 task fails, STOP before Group 3
   - Mark failed tasks as "blocked" in Archon
   - Log failure reasons for debugging

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Update Archon task status: `todo` → `doing` → `done`
   - Emit progress events: "Group 1: 3/8 tasks complete (37%)"
   - Display estimated time remaining

4. **Context Preparation**:
   - Each implementer receives full PRP context
   - Include completed dependencies from previous groups
   - Provide section name for ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Include validation criteria from PRP

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Bottlenecks

1. **Group 1 Long-Running Tasks**:
   - **Risk**: Task 1 (Vector DB Evaluation) and Task 3 (Search Pipeline) may take longer than estimated (60+ minutes)
   - **Impact**: Delays start of Group 2
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Monitor progress, send reminders at 45-minute mark
     - If consistently over time, adjust estimates for future PRPs
     - Can start Group 2 early if Tasks 1 and 2 complete (even if others still running)

2. **Group 2 Dependency Conflicts**:
   - **Risk**: Task 8 (Cost Analysis) needs multiple Group 1 outputs; if any incomplete, Task 8 blocked
   - **Impact**: Cannot proceed to Group 3 (Final Assembly)
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Verify ALL Group 1 dependencies complete before starting Task 8
     - If specific dependency missing, can proceed with "TBD" placeholders
     - Final Assembly (Task 11) will catch any gaps

3. **Final Assembly Complexity**:
   - **Risk**: Task 11 discovers inconsistencies across sections (terminology, assumptions)
   - **Impact**: Requires rework, sends tasks back to Group 1/2 implementers
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Provide clear terminology guidelines to all Group 1 implementers
     - Include cross-reference validation in Task 11 steps
     - Budget extra 10 minutes for minor corrections

### Parallelization Benefits

**Group 1 Benefits** (8 tasks in parallel):
- **Time saved**: 300 minutes (5 hours)
- **Efficiency**: 83% reduction vs sequential
- **Rationale**: Research tasks have zero inter-dependencies
- **Risk**: Very low - tasks operate on different topics and sections

**Group 2 Benefits** (2 tasks in parallel):
- **Time saved**: 35 minutes
- **Efficiency**: 50% reduction vs sequential
- **Rationale**: Docker config and cost analysis are independent outputs
- **Risk**: Low - different sections, different concerns

**Overall Benefits**:
- **Total time saved**: 335 minutes (5.6 hours)
- **Overall efficiency**: 65% faster than sequential
- **Parallelization rate**: 91% of tasks (10 of 11 in parallel groups)
- **Risk**: Low - well-defined dependencies, clear interfaces between groups

### Resource Contention Analysis

**No Contention**:
- **File writes**: Each task writes to different ARCHITECTURE.md section
- **Database access**: Research PRP has no database operations
- **API calls**: Each task researches different documentation sites
- **Archon updates**: Independent task status updates (no shared state)

**Potential Contention**:
- **LLM token limits**: 8 simultaneous implementers may hit rate limits
  - **Mitigation**: Stagger invocations by 5 seconds if rate limits encountered
  - **Likelihood**: Low - research tasks use fewer tokens than code generation

- **Memory usage**: 8 simultaneous subagents may use significant memory
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor system resources, reduce parallelism if memory constrained
  - **Likelihood**: Low - research tasks are less memory-intensive than compilation

---

## Assumptions Made

### Assumption 1: Section Independence
**Assumption**: Each ARCHITECTURE.md section can be written independently without cross-references during initial drafting.

**Rationale**:
- Research tasks explore different topics (vector DB, schema, search, ingestion, etc.)
- Cross-references added during Final Assembly (Task 11)
- Similar to writing different chapters of a book simultaneously

**If Wrong**:
- Some sections may have gaps or inconsistencies
- Task 11 (Final Assembly) will identify and fix these
- May require 10-15 minutes extra for alignment corrections

**Confidence**: High (95%) - Research PRPs naturally partition into independent topics

---

### Assumption 2: Task Duration Estimates
**Assumption**: Task durations are estimated correctly (35-60 minutes per task).

**Rationale**:
- Based on similar research tasks in past PRPs
- Accounts for reading documentation, writing analysis, creating examples
- Includes buffer for unexpected complexity

**If Wrong**:
- Group 1 may take longer than 60 minutes (up to 90 minutes)
- Group 2 may take longer than 35 minutes (up to 50 minutes)
- Overall timeline extends but parallelization still saves significant time

**Adjustment Strategy**:
- Track actual durations for first execution
- Update estimates for future research PRPs
- Even with 50% overrun, still 40% faster than sequential

**Confidence**: Medium (70%) - Research tasks vary widely in complexity

---

### Assumption 3: No Circular Dependencies
**Assumption**: Tasks 1-10 have clear, acyclic dependencies (no task depends on its dependents).

**Rationale**:
- Dependency graph manually validated (see Mermaid diagram)
- Group 1 → Group 2 → Group 3 forms clear DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- No backward dependencies detected

**If Wrong**:
- Circular dependency would deadlock execution
- Would require manual intervention to break cycle
- Must restructure execution plan

**Verification**:
```python
# Pseudo-code to detect circular dependencies
def has_cycle(task_graph):
    visited = set()
    rec_stack = set()

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        rec_stack.add(node)

        for neighbor in task_graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif neighbor in rec_stack:
                return True  # Cycle detected!

        rec_stack.remove(node)
        return False

    for node in task_graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False

# Run check on execution plan
assert not has_cycle(execution_plan), "Circular dependency detected!"
```

**Confidence**: Very High (99%) - Manually verified dependency graph

---

### Assumption 4: Implementers Can Work Independently
**Assumption**: Multiple implementer subagents can run simultaneously without coordination overhead.

**Rationale**:
- Each implementer receives complete task context
- No shared state between implementers (except reading PRP file)
- Modern async execution supports parallel agent invocation

**If Wrong**:
- May need coordination layer for implementers
- Could add 5-10 minutes overhead per group
- Still faster than sequential execution

**Confidence**: High (90%) - Standard pattern for parallel task execution

---

### Assumption 5: Archon Task Management Supports Parallel Updates
**Assumption**: Archon MCP server can handle multiple task status updates simultaneously.

**Rationale**:
- Database-backed task storage supports concurrent writes
- Task IDs are unique (no collision risk)
- Updates are independent transactions

**If Wrong**:
- May need to serialize Archon updates (add 1-2 minutes overhead)
- Does not affect implementer parallelization
- Minor impact on overall timeline

**Confidence**: High (95%) - Database systems designed for concurrent access

---

## Execution Order Summary

**Step-by-step execution sequence**:

```
START
  │
  ├─→ GROUP 1 (Parallel): Launch 8 tasks simultaneously
  │    ├─ Task 1: Vector DB Evaluation
  │    ├─ Task 2: PostgreSQL Schema Design
  │    ├─ Task 3: Search Pipeline Architecture
  │    ├─ Task 4: Document Ingestion Pipeline
  │    ├─ Task 5: MCP Tools Specification
  │    ├─ Task 6: Service Layer Architecture
  │    ├─ Task 9: Testing Strategy
  │    └─ Task 10: Migration from Archon
  │
  │   [WAIT: All 8 tasks complete - ~60 minutes]
  │
  ├─→ GROUP 2 (Parallel): Launch 2 tasks simultaneously
  │    ├─ Task 7: Docker Compose Configuration (depends on Tasks 1, 2)
  │    └─ Task 8: Cost & Performance Analysis (depends on Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4)
  │
  │   [WAIT: Both tasks complete - ~35 minutes]
  │
  ├─→ GROUP 3 (Sequential): Launch 1 task
  │    └─ Task 11: Final Assembly & Review (depends on Tasks 1-10)
  │
  │   [WAIT: Task complete - ~20 minutes]
  │
END

Total Time: 115 minutes (1.9 hours)
Time Saved: 215 minutes (3.6 hours) vs sequential
Efficiency Gain: 65%
```

**Validation Gates**:
- After Group 1: Verify all 8 tasks marked "done" in Archon
- After Group 2: Verify both tasks marked "done" in Archon
- After Group 3: Verify ARCHITECTURE.md exists and passes completeness checks

**Rollback Strategy**:
- If any Group 1 task fails: Retry failed task individually
- If any Group 2 task fails: Check if Group 1 outputs complete; retry with clarifications
- If Group 3 fails: Review all sections, identify gaps, send specific tasks back to implementers

Task 5  |████████|     45 min   [220-265]
Task 6  |██████████|   50 min   [265-315]
Task 7  |████████|     40 min   [315-355]
Task 8  |████████|     40 min   [355-395]
Task 9  |████████|     45 min   [395-440]
Task 10 |███████|      35 min   [440-475]
Task 11 |████|         20 min   [475-495]

TOTAL: 495 minutes (8.25 hours)
```

### Parallel Execution Timeline

```
PARALLEL (This Execution Plan):

GROUP 1 (8 tasks in parallel):
Tasks 1-6, 9-10 |████████████| 60 min [0-60]
                 (longest task duration)

GROUP 2 (2 tasks in parallel):
Tasks 7-8       |███████|      35 min [60-95]
                 (longest task duration)

GROUP 3 (1 task sequential):
Task 11         |████|         20 min [95-115]

TOTAL: 115 minutes (1.9 hours)
```

### Comparison Table

| Metric | Sequential | Parallel | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Total Time** | 495 min (8.25 hr) | 115 min (1.9 hr) | 380 min saved (6.35 hr) |
| **Efficiency** | Baseline | 77% faster | +77% |
| **Task Throughput** | 1 task at a time | Up to 8 tasks at a time | 8x throughput |
| **Idle Time** | 0% (always working) | 0% (all agents busy) | No waste |
| **Risk Level** | Low (simple) | Low (well-structured) | Equivalent |
| **Coordination Overhead** | None | Minimal (2 group transitions) | +5 min total |
| **Parallelization Rate** | 0% | 91% | +91% |

**Key Insight**: Parallel execution reduces research time from full workday (8+ hours) to lunch break duration (2 hours), enabling same-day PRP completion.
