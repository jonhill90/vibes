- Preserved all technical specifications, code examples, and diagrams
- Added contextual transitions between sections

#### 2. Executive Summary
- Synthesized 2-3 paragraph overview of RAG service architecture
- Highlighted key decisions: Qdrant selection, PostgreSQL schema, hybrid search
- Summarized cost estimates and performance targets
- Noted migration strategy from existing Archon service

#### 3. Navigation & Structure
- Generated comprehensive table of contents with hyperlinks
- Organized 12 major sections with consistent heading levels
- Added success criteria checklist from PRP (lines 54-68)
- Created 3 appendices for quick reference material

#### 4. Technical Completeness
- Vector database comparison matrix (Qdrant recommended)
- Complete PostgreSQL schema with CREATE TABLE statements
- Search pipeline flow (base → hybrid → reranking)
- Document ingestion with quota exhaustion handling
- MCP tools specification (4 tools with parameters)
- Service layer architecture with tuple[bool, dict] pattern
- Docker Compose configuration with all services
- Cost analysis: MVP ($41-61/month), Production ($87-127/month), Enterprise ($290-400/month)
- Testing strategy (80% coverage target)
- Migration notes (keep/change/simplify from Archon)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Research Section Integration
**Challenge**: Ensuring all 10 sections flow coherently without duplication or gaps
**Implementation**:
- Read all sections first to understand overlaps
- Maintained section boundaries while adding connective text
- Preserved all technical details from source sections

#### Success Criteria Validation
**Challenge**: Verifying all 12 PRP success criteria were met
**Implementation**:
- Cross-referenced each checklist item against assembled content
- Confirmed presence of: comparison table, schema, indexes, flow diagram, ingestion pipeline, MCP spec, class diagram, Docker config, env template, cost estimates, testing strategy, migration notes
- All 12 items verified and marked complete

#### Cross-Reference Integrity
**Challenge**: Maintaining valid section references across large document
**Implementation**:
- Used markdown anchor links for table of contents
- Ensured all section headings matched TOC entries
- Added "See Section X" references where appropriate

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- Task 1 (Vector Database Evaluation): Section 01 fully integrated
- Task 2 (PostgreSQL Schema Design): Section 02 with complete CREATE TABLE statements included
- Task 3 (Search Pipeline Architecture): Section 03 with three-tier strategy documented
- Task 4 (Document Ingestion Pipeline): Section 04 with quota exhaustion handling included
- Task 5 (MCP Tools Specification): Section 05 with 4 tools fully specified
- Task 6 (Service Layer Design): Section 06 with tuple[bool, dict] pattern documented
- Task 7 (Docker Compose Configuration): Section 07 with complete orchestration setup
- Task 8 (Cost & Performance Analysis): Section 08 with all pricing tiers and benchmarks
- Task 9 (Testing Strategy): Section 09 with 80% coverage target and test patterns
- Task 10 (Migration Notes): Section 10 with keep/change/simplify analysis

### External Dependencies:
None - This was a documentation assembly task with no external dependencies.

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Routing Added):
- [x] Verified all 10 source section files exist and are readable
- [x] Confirmed ARCHITECTURE.md created in root directory
- [x] Validated table of contents hyperlinks work correctly
- [x] Checked all 12 success criteria items present in document
- [x] Verified executive summary synthesizes key decisions
- [x] Confirmed appendices contain complete reference material
- [x] Validated implementation roadmap includes all 8 phases
- [x] Ensured no section content was lost during assembly

### Validation Results:
- All 10 research sections successfully read and integrated
- ARCHITECTURE.md created with 2401 lines of comprehensive documentation
- Success criteria checklist: 12/12 items verified
- Table of contents: 12 major sections + 3 appendices
- Executive summary: 3 paragraphs covering architecture, cost, and migration
- Implementation roadmap: 8 phases from MVP to advanced features
- No errors or warnings during assembly process

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Document Structure**: Maintained original 10-section structure rather than reorganizing, preserving research section integrity
2. **Executive Summary Scope**: Focused on architecture decisions, cost analysis, and migration strategy (3 key areas)
3. **Appendix Content**: Included complete PostgreSQL schema, MCP response examples, and performance benchmarks for quick reference
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Created 8-phase roadmap from MVP through advanced features to guide development

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Section Length**: Combined document is very comprehensive (2401 lines) - considered adding section summaries but decided completeness was priority
2. **Cross-Reference Management**: Ensured all "See Section X" references remained valid after assembly
3. **Code Example Formatting**: Preserved all code blocks from source sections with proper syntax highlighting

## Next Steps

1. Review ARCHITECTURE.md with stakeholders
2. Begin Phase 1 (MVP Setup) per implementation roadmap:
   - Set up Docker Compose environment
   - Initialize PostgreSQL and Qdrant
   - Implement basic search functionality
3. Update Archon task status to "review"
4. Proceed to implementation phases based on priority
