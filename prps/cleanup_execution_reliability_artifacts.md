# PRP: Cleanup Execution Reliability Artifacts

**Generated**: 2025-10-07
**Based On**: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/INITIAL_cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts.md
**Archon Project**: a5f4959f-24e9-4816-8506-fa59a8330714

---

## Goal

Consolidate split directories (`prps/execution_reliability/` and `prps/execution_reliability/`), remove redundant "prp_" prefix from naming convention, update all documentation references, relocate orphaned test script from root directory, and document template location conventions. This surgical cleanup establishes a clean slate for future PRPs while preserving all functionality and documentation integrity.

**End State**:
- Single consolidated directory: `prps/execution_reliability/` (not 2 split locations)
- PRP file renamed: `prps/execution_reliability.md` (no redundant prefix)
- Zero instances of "execution_reliability" in documentation (except git history)
- Test script relocated: `prps/test_validation_gates/test_script.py` (not root)
- Template locations documented: `.claude/templates/README.md` explains execution vs generation templates
- Git history preserved for all file operations

---

## Why

**Current Pain Points**:
- **Split directories**: Content scattered across `prps/execution_reliability/` and `prps/execution_reliability/` - hard to find artifacts
- **Redundant naming**: `execution_reliability` has unnecessary "prp_" prefix (already in `prps/` directory)
- **Root directory clutter**: `test_validation_gates_script.py` orphaned in root instead of feature-scoped location
- **Template confusion**: Two template locations (`.claude/templates/` and `prps/templates/`) without clear documentation of when to use which

**Business Value**:
- **Blocks future PRPs**: HIGH priority cleanup enables standardization PRP (INITIAL_standardize_prp_naming_convention.md)
- **Sets precedent**: Establishes "no redundant prefixes" convention for all future PRPs
- **Developer experience**: Clear, single source of truth for finding execution artifacts
- **Maintainability**: Consistent naming reduces cognitive load for future developers

---

## What

### Core Features

1. **Directory Consolidation**: Move all contents from `prps/execution_reliability/` → `prps/execution_reliability/`
2. **PRP File Rename**: `prps/execution_reliability.md` → `prps/execution_reliability.md`
3. **Documentation Updates**: Replace all instances of "execution_reliability" with "execution_reliability" across 10+ files
4. **Test Script Relocation**: Move `test_validation_gates_script.py` from root to `prps/test_validation_gates/test_script.py`
5. **Template Location Documentation**: Create `.claude/templates/README.md` explaining template usage

### Success Criteria

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- ✅ 1 directory: `prps/execution_reliability/` (not 2 split directories)
- ✅ 3 subdirectories: `examples/`, `planning/`, `execution/`
- ✅ 0 instances of `execution_reliability` in docs (except git history)
- ✅ 0 files in root matching `test_validation_gates_script.py`
- ✅ 100% of file paths in documentation resolve correctly

**Qualitative Criteria**:
- ✅ Git history preserved (all operations use `git mv`)
- ✅ Clear understanding of which templates are where
- ✅ No confusion about naming conventions going forward
- ✅ Clean slate for future PRPs (precedent set)

  sections:
    - "git mv Command Syntax" - Preserving file history during moves/renames
    - "Rename Detection" - How Git tracks files across renames (similarity heuristics)
  why: Essential for preserving git history. Must use git mv not shell mv.
  critical_gotchas:
    - Commit renames SEPARATELY from content changes (or similarity drops below 50% and history breaks)
    - Git doesn't track renames explicitly - it guesses them post-hoc
    - Combining move + content change in same commit = "deleted + added" not "renamed"

  sections:
    - "Best practices for preserving history during refactoring"
    - "Using --follow flag to track files across renames"
  why: Community-validated patterns for complex refactoring scenarios
  critical: Use --follow flag and commit renames separately

    - "Directory Operations" - iterdir(), mkdir(), rmdir() patterns
  why: Modern approach to file system operations with safety patterns
  critical_gotchas:
    - TOCTOU race condition: Use try-except not check-then-use
    - rmdir() only works on empty directories (fail-safe)
    - Cross-platform: rename() behaves differently on Unix vs Windows

  why: Bulk text replacement across multiple files
  critical_gotchas:
    - BSD sed (macOS) vs GNU sed (Linux) incompatibility with -i flag
    - Use alternative delimiters (|, :, #) when replacing paths with /
    - Always create backups with -i.bak before bulk operations

# ESSENTIAL LOCAL FILES
- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/README.md
  why: Comprehensive guide with 4 runnable code examples for this cleanup
  pattern: Pre-flight checks, git mv operations, multi-file find/replace, validation suites

- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/git_mv_operations.sh
  why: Safe directory consolidation and file renaming with git history preservation
  critical: Always use git mv not shell mv - includes rollback capability

- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/multi_file_find_replace.py
  why: Safe multi-file text replacement with validation and backup
  pattern: Dry run → confirm → backup → execute → validate workflow

- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/validation_checks.sh
  why: Comprehensive validation suite for file operations
  critical: Validates both positive (files exist) and negative (old files removed)

- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/directory_tree_visualization.py
  why: Generate before/after directory tree visualizations for documentation
  pattern: Tree output with statistics (file count, size, types)

- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/planning/codebase-patterns.md
  why: 5 architectural patterns extracted from codebase (git mv, safe cleanup, find/replace, scoped dirs, EAFP validation)
  critical: Pattern 1 (git mv) and Pattern 2 (safe deletion) are non-negotiable

- file: /Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/planning/gotchas.md
  why: 12 comprehensive gotchas with detection methods and mitigations
  critical: Gotcha #1 (git history loss from content changes during rename) is MOST CRITICAL

**Problems**:
1. Split directories: Content across `execution_reliability/` and `execution_reliability/`
2. Redundant prefix: `execution_reliability.md` unnecessary `prp_` prefix
3. Orphaned file: `TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md` in wrong subdirectory
4. Root clutter: `test_validation_gates_script.py` doesn't belong in root
5. Template confusion: Two locations without documentation

**New Files Created**:
- `.claude/templates/README.md` - Documents execution vs generation template distinction

**Files Moved** (with git mv to preserve history):
- `prps/execution_reliability/examples/` → `prps/execution_reliability/examples/`
- `prps/execution_reliability/planning/` → `prps/execution_reliability/planning/`
- `prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md` → `prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- `prps/execution_reliability.md` → `prps/execution_reliability.md`
- `test_validation_gates_script.py` → `prps/test_validation_gates/test_script.py`

**Directories Deleted** (after validation):
- `prps/execution_reliability/` (verified empty before deletion)

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```python
# CRITICAL GOTCHA #1: Git History Loss from Content Changes During Rename
# Severity: CRITICAL
# Git uses heuristic-based similarity detection. Combining rename + content change
# in same commit causes similarity to drop below 50% threshold, breaking history.

# ❌ WRONG - Loses git history
git mv prps/execution_reliability.md prps/execution_reliability.md
sed -i 's/execution_reliability/execution_reliability/g' prps/execution_reliability.md
git commit -am "Rename and update PRP file"
# Result: Git sees "deleted + added", NOT "renamed"

# ✅ RIGHT - Separate commits preserve history
# Commit 1: Pure rename (no content changes)
git mv prps/execution_reliability.md prps/execution_reliability.md
git commit -m "Rename: execution_reliability.md → execution_reliability.md"

# Commit 2: Content updates (after rename committed)
sed -i 's/execution_reliability/execution_reliability/g' prps/execution_reliability.md
git commit -am "Update internal references to new name"

# Verification: Check rename detected
git log --follow --oneline prps/execution_reliability.md
# Should show full history including pre-rename commits

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #2: TOCTOU Race Condition in File Operations
# Severity: CRITICAL (CWE-367 security vulnerability)
# Time-of-check to time-of-use: file state changes between check and operation

# ❌ VULNERABLE - Check-then-use pattern
if Path("source").exists():
    # GAP: File could be deleted/modified here by another process
    shutil.move("source", "dest")

# ✅ SECURE - Try-except pattern (atomic operation, EAFP)
import subprocess

def safe_git_move(source, dest):
    try:
        # Single atomic operation - no gap between check and use
        subprocess.run(["git", "mv", str(source), str(dest)], check=True)
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        if "does not exist" in e.stderr:
            print(f"Source doesn't exist (already moved?): {source}")
        elif "already exists" in e.stderr:
            print(f"Destination already exists: {dest}")
        return False

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #3: Accidental Data Loss from Non-Empty Directory Deletion
# Severity: CRITICAL
# rm -rf deletes everything without verification. Hidden files (.DS_Store, .gitkeep)
# not visible with ls cause silent data loss.

# ❌ DANGEROUS - Deletes everything without verification
rm -rf prps/execution_reliability/
# No error even if directory has files! SILENT DATA LOSS.

# ✅ SAFE - Use rmdir (fails if not empty) + verify with find
#!/bin/bash
delete_empty_directory() {
    local dir_path="$1"

    # Use find to catch hidden files (ls misses them)
    local file_count=$(find "${dir_path}" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 | wc -l)

    if [ "${file_count}" -ne "0" ]; then
        echo "❌ Directory not empty (${file_count} items remain):"
        find "${dir_path}" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1
        return 1
    fi

    # Use rmdir not rm -rf (fail-safe)
    rmdir "${dir_path}"
    echo "✅ Deleted empty directory: ${dir_path}"
}

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #4: Partial Find/Replace from Incomplete File Discovery
# Severity: HIGH
# Manually specifying files instead of comprehensive grep misses references

# ❌ WRONG - Manual file list (misses files)
sed -i 's/execution_reliability/execution_reliability/g' prps/execution_reliability.md
sed -i 's/execution_reliability/execution_reliability/g' prps/execution_reliability/execution/EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md
# Problem: What about TASK*_COMPLETION.md? .claude/commands/execute-prp.md?

# ✅ RIGHT - Comprehensive grep first, then update ALL files
#!/bin/bash
OLD_TEXT="execution_reliability"
NEW_TEXT="execution_reliability"

# Step 1: Find ALL files
FILES=$(grep -rl "${OLD_TEXT}" prps/ 2>/dev/null)
echo "Files to update: $(echo $FILES | wc -w)"

# Step 2: Create backups
for file in $FILES; do cp "${file}" "${file}.bak"; done

# Step 3: Execute replacement
for file in $FILES; do
    sed -i '' "s/${OLD_TEXT}/${NEW_TEXT}/g" "${file}"  # macOS
done

# Step 4: Verify 0 instances remain
grep -r "${OLD_TEXT}" prps/ || echo "✅ All instances replaced"

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #5: Sed Path Delimiter Collision
# Severity: HIGH
# Using / delimiter when replacing file paths causes syntax errors

# ❌ WRONG - Forward slash delimiter (requires escaping)
sed 's/prps\/execution_reliability/prps\/execution_reliability/g' file.md
# Unreadable, error-prone

# ✅ RIGHT - Use alternative delimiter (| : # @)
sed 's|prps/execution_reliability|prps/execution_reliability|g' file.md
# Clean, readable, no escaping needed

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #6: BSD vs GNU Sed Incompatibility
# Severity: HIGH
# macOS (BSD sed) vs Linux (GNU sed) handle -i flag differently

# ❌ WRONG - Works on Linux, fails on macOS
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.md
# macOS error: "invalid command code"

# ✅ RIGHT - Portable across macOS and Linux
sed -i.bak 's/old/new/g' file.md
# Creates file.md.bak on both platforms

# Or platform detection:
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
    sed -i '' 's/old/new/g' file.md  # macOS
else
    sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.md     # Linux
fi

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #7: Markdown Link Variations Breaking References
# Severity: HIGH
# Multiple link syntax variations: [text](path), [text](path/), path, ./path, ../path

# ❌ WRONG - Only catches one variation
sed 's/execution_reliability/execution_reliability/g' file.md
# Misses: trailing slashes, relative paths, inline code

# ✅ RIGHT - Update all variations
find prps/ -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' \
    -e "s|prps/${OLD_NAME}/|prps/${NEW_NAME}/|g" \
    -e "s|prps/${OLD_NAME})|prps/${NEW_NAME})|g" \
    -e "s|prps/${OLD_NAME}|prps/${NEW_NAME}|g" \
    -e "s|\.\./${OLD_NAME}/|\.\\./${NEW_NAME}/|g" \
    -e "s|\`${OLD_NAME}\`|\`${NEW_NAME}\`|g" \
    -e "s|${OLD_NAME}\.md|${NEW_NAME}.md|g" \
    -e "s|${OLD_NAME}|${NEW_NAME}|g" \
    {} \;

# CRITICAL GOTCHA #8: Shell mv Instead of git mv (History Loss)
# Severity: HIGH
# Using shell mv or shutil.move() instead of git mv breaks history tracking

# ❌ WRONG - Shell mv (loses history)
mv prps/execution_reliability.md prps/execution_reliability.md
git add prps/execution_reliability.md
git rm prps/execution_reliability.md
# Result: Git sees "deleted + added", not "renamed"

# ✅ RIGHT - Use git mv
git mv prps/execution_reliability.md prps/execution_reliability.md
# Git immediately records as rename in index

# Verification:
git log --follow prps/execution_reliability.md
# Should show full history including pre-rename commits
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 0: Planning & Understanding

**BEFORE starting implementation, complete these steps:**

1. **Study Examples** (45-60 minutes):
   - Read `/Users/jon/source/vibes/prps/cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts/examples/README.md` - Comprehensive guide
   - Review `git_mv_operations.sh` - Directory consolidation patterns
   - Review `multi_file_find_replace.py` - Text replacement patterns
   - Review `validation_checks.sh` - Validation patterns

2. **Key Patterns to Mimic**:
   - Pre-flight checks before ALL file operations
   - Git history preservation (git mv, never shell mv)
   - Dry run → confirm → execute workflow
   - Backup before modification
   - Comprehensive validation (both positive and negative checks)

3. **Understand Critical Rules**:
   - NEVER combine rename + content change in same commit (breaks git history)
   - ALWAYS use `git mv` not shell `mv` (preserves history)
   - ALWAYS grep for ALL instances before find/replace (prevent partial updates)
   - ALWAYS verify directory empty with `find` before deletion (catch hidden files)

### Task List (Execute in Order)

```yaml
Task 1: Directory Consolidation - Move Split Directories
RESPONSIBILITY: Consolidate execution_reliability/ and execution_reliability/ into single directory

FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY:
  - prps/execution_reliability/examples/ (move destination)
  - prps/execution_reliability/planning/ (move destination)
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md (move destination)

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: examples/git_mv_operations.sh - move_directory_contents()

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Pre-flight validation:
     - Verify source exists: prps/execution_reliability/examples
     - Verify source exists: prps/execution_reliability/planning
     - Verify source exists: prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md
     - Verify destination doesn't exist (prevent overwrite)

  2. Move directories with git mv (preserves history):
     git mv prps/execution_reliability/examples prps/execution_reliability/
     git mv prps/execution_reliability/planning prps/execution_reliability/
     git mv prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md \
            prps/execution_reliability/execution/

  3. Verify moves succeeded:
     - Check prps/execution_reliability/examples exists
     - Check prps/execution_reliability/planning exists
     - Check prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_TEST_RESULTS.md exists

VALIDATION:
  - Git status shows "renamed:" not "deleted:" + "new file:"
  - All 3 items successfully moved
  - Source locations no longer exist

---

Task 2: PRP File Rename - Remove Redundant Prefix
RESPONSIBILITY: Rename execution_reliability.md → execution_reliability.md

FILES TO MODIFY:
  - prps/execution_reliability.md → prps/execution_reliability.md

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: examples/git_mv_operations.sh - rename_file_with_git()

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Pre-flight check:
     - Verify prps/execution_reliability.md exists
     - Verify prps/execution_reliability.md doesn't exist

  2. Rename with git mv (preserve history):
     git mv prps/execution_reliability.md prps/execution_reliability.md

  3. Commit IMMEDIATELY (separate from content changes):
     git commit -m "Rename: execution_reliability.md → execution_reliability.md"

CRITICAL: Do NOT update file contents yet. Commit rename FIRST to preserve git history.

VALIDATION:
  - Git status shows "renamed:" not "deleted + new file"
  - git log --follow prps/execution_reliability.md shows full history
  - File exists at new location

---

Task 3: PRP File Content Update - Internal References
RESPONSIBILITY: Update all instances of "execution_reliability" in the PRP file itself

FILES TO MODIFY:
  - prps/execution_reliability.md (content only, already renamed in Task 2)

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: examples/multi_file_find_replace.py - find_replace_in_file()

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Find all instances in PRP file:
     grep -n "execution_reliability" prps/execution_reliability.md

  2. Create backup:
     cp prps/execution_reliability.md prps/execution_reliability.md.bak

  3. Replace with alternative delimiter (avoid path escaping):
     sed -i '' 's|execution_reliability|execution_reliability|g' prps/execution_reliability.md

  4. Verify replacement:
     grep "execution_reliability" prps/execution_reliability.md
     # Should return 0 results

  5. Commit content changes (separate from rename):
     git commit -am "Update internal references in execution_reliability.md"

VALIDATION:
  - 0 instances of "execution_reliability" in file
  - File content otherwise intact
  - Separate commit from rename (verify with git log)

---

Task 4: Documentation Updates - Completion Reports
RESPONSIBILITY: Update all TASK*_COMPLETION.md files with new feature name

FILES TO MODIFY:
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK1_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK2_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK3_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK4_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK5_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK6_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK7_COMPLETION.md
  - prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK8_COMPLETION.md

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: examples/multi_file_find_replace.py - comprehensive_find_replace()

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Find ALL completion reports:
     FILES=$(find prps/execution_reliability/execution -name "TASK*_COMPLETION.md")
     echo "Files to update: $(echo $FILES | wc -w)"

  2. Create backups:
     for file in $FILES; do cp "${file}" "${file}.bak"; done

  3. Execute replacement (alternative delimiter for paths):
     for file in $FILES; do
         sed -i '' 's|execution_reliability|execution_reliability|g' "${file}"
     done

  4. Verify 0 instances remain:
     grep -r "execution_reliability" prps/execution_reliability/execution/TASK*_COMPLETION.md
     # Should return nothing

  5. Clean up backups after verification:
     find prps/execution_reliability/execution -name "*.bak" -delete

VALIDATION:
  - All 8 completion reports updated
  - 0 instances of old naming in completion reports
  - All file paths in reports resolve correctly

---

Task 5: Documentation Updates - Execution Summary
RESPONSIBILITY: Update EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md with new feature name and paths

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: Feature analysis template documentation requirements

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Create .claude/templates/README.md with content:
     ```markdown
     # Template Locations Guide

     This repository has TWO template locations with different purposes:

     ## `.claude/templates/` - PRP Execution Templates

     **Purpose**: Templates used DURING PRP execution by subagents

     **Files**:
     - task-completion-report.md - Task completion documentation
     - test-generation-report.md - Test coverage reports
     - validation-report.md - Validation gate results
     - completion-report.md - Legacy completion template

     **When to use**:
     - Creating completion reports during /execute-prp
     - Generating test reports in validation phase
     - Documenting task implementation

     ## `prps/templates/` - PRP Generation Templates

     **Purpose**: Templates used DURING PRP generation by /generate-prp

     **Files**:
     - prp_base.md - Base PRP structure
     - feature_template.md - Feature implementation PRPs
     - tool_template.md - Tool integration PRPs
     - documentation_template.md - Documentation PRPs

     **When to use**:
     - Generating new PRPs with /generate-prp
     - Creating consistent PRP structure
     - Assembling PRP from research artifacts

     ## Quick Reference

     **Need to...** | **Use Template From**
     ---|---
     Document task completion | `.claude/templates/task-completion-report.md`
     Generate test report | `.claude/templates/test-generation-report.md`
     Create new PRP | `prps/templates/prp_base.md`
     Validate implementation | `.claude/templates/validation-report.md`
     ```

Task 8: Directory Cleanup - Delete Empty execution_reliability
RESPONSIBILITY: Safely delete empty execution_reliability directory

FILES TO DELETE:
  - prps/execution_reliability/ (verify empty first)

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: examples/git_mv_operations.sh - delete_empty_directory()

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Verify directory empty with find (catches hidden files):
     FILE_COUNT=$(find prps/execution_reliability -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 | wc -l)

     if [ "${FILE_COUNT}" -ne "0" ]; then
         echo "❌ Directory not empty (${FILE_COUNT} items remain):"
         find prps/execution_reliability -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1
         exit 1
     fi

  2. Use rmdir (fail-safe - won't delete non-empty):
     rmdir prps/execution_reliability

     if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
         echo "✅ Deleted empty directory"
     else
         echo "❌ Failed to delete (directory not empty?)"
         ls -la prps/execution_reliability
         exit 1
     fi

CRITICAL: Use rmdir NOT rm -rf. rmdir fails if directory not empty (prevents data loss).

VALIDATION:
  - Directory prps/execution_reliability no longer exists
  - No errors during deletion
  - Used rmdir not rm -rf

---

Task 9: Comprehensive Validation
RESPONSIBILITY: Verify all cleanup operations completed successfully

PATTERN TO FOLLOW: examples/validation_checks.sh

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Validate directory structure:
     - ✅ prps/execution_reliability/examples exists
     - ✅ prps/execution_reliability/planning exists
     - ✅ prps/execution_reliability/execution exists
     - ❌ prps/execution_reliability doesn't exist

  2. Validate file renames:
     - ✅ prps/execution_reliability.md exists
     - ❌ prps/execution_reliability.md doesn't exist
     - ✅ prps/test_validation_gates/test_script.py exists
     - ❌ test_validation_gates_script.py doesn't exist (root)

  3. Validate references updated (0 old naming):
     REFS=$(grep -r "execution_reliability" prps/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
     if [ "${REFS}" -eq "0" ]; then
         echo "✅ All references updated (0 instances)"
     else
         echo "❌ Found ${REFS} instances of old naming:"
         grep -rn "execution_reliability" prps/
         exit 1
     fi

  4. Validate git history preserved:
     git log --follow --oneline prps/execution_reliability.md | head -5
     # Should show commits from BEFORE rename

  5. Validate file accessibility (spot checks):
     test_files=(
         "prps/execution_reliability.md"
         "prps/execution_reliability/examples/README.md"
         "prps/execution_reliability/planning/feature-analysis.md"
         "prps/execution_reliability/execution/EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md"
         "prps/test_validation_gates/test_script.py"
     )

     for file in "${test_files[@]}"; do
         if [ -f "$file" ]; then
             echo "✅ Accessible: $file"
         else
             echo "❌ Missing: $file"
             exit 1
         fi
     done

VALIDATION:
  - All validation checks pass
  - 0 instances of old naming (except git history)
  - Git history preserved for all moved files
  - All file paths accessible

SPECIFIC STEPS:
  1. Review git status:
     git status
     # Should show renamed files and modified documentation

  2. Verify all changes staged:
     git diff --cached --stat

  3. Create comprehensive commit:
     git commit -m "Cleanup: Consolidate execution_reliability artifacts

     - Consolidated split directories (execution_reliability → execution_reliability)
     - Renamed PRP file to remove redundant prefix
     - Updated 10+ documentation files with new naming
     - Relocated test script to feature-scoped directory
     - Documented template location conventions
     - Deleted empty execution_reliability directory

     Closes: cleanup_execution_reliability_artifacts
     Sets precedent: No redundant prp_ prefix in prps/ directory"

  4. Final validation:
     - Run validation script from Task 9
     - Verify git log shows proper rename detection
     - Confirm 0 old references in codebase

VALIDATION:
  - Single atomic commit for entire cleanup
  - Descriptive commit message
  - All validation gates pass
  - Git history preserved
```

## Final Validation Checklist

Before marking cleanup complete:

- [ ] **Directory Structure**
  - [ ] Single consolidated directory: `prps/execution_reliability/`
  - [ ] Contains `examples/`, `planning/`, `execution/` subdirectories
  - [ ] Old directory `prps/execution_reliability/` deleted
  - [ ] Test script in feature-scoped directory: `prps/test_validation_gates/`

- [ ] **File Operations**
  - [ ] PRP file renamed: `prps/execution_reliability.md`
  - [ ] Test script relocated and renamed: `prps/test_validation_gates/test_script.py`
  - [ ] All moves used `git mv` (not shell `mv`)
  - [ ] Git status shows "renamed:" not "deleted + added"

- [ ] **Documentation Updates**

  - [ ] ✅ Comprehensive grep before find/replace (no partial updates)
  - [ ] ✅ Alternative sed delimiters for paths (no escaping hell)
  - [ ] ✅ Verified directory empty with `find` before deletion (catch hidden files)
  - [ ] ✅ Try-except pattern not check-then-use (no TOCTOU vulnerability)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Critical Anti-Patterns

1. **Combining Rename + Content Change in Same Commit**
   - **Problem**: Git similarity detection fails, history breaks
   - **Solution**: Commit 1 = rename only, Commit 2 = content updates

2. **Using Shell `mv` Instead of `git mv`**
   - **Problem**: Git sees delete+add, not rename. History lost.
   - **Solution**: ALWAYS use `git mv` in git repositories

3. **Check-Then-Use File Operations** (TOCTOU vulnerability)
   - **Problem**: File state changes between check and use
   - **Solution**: Use try-except (EAFP), not if-exists-then-move

4. **Using `rm -rf` for Directory Deletion**
   - **Problem**: Deletes everything including hidden files. Silent data loss.
   - **Solution**: Use `rmdir` (fails if not empty) + verify with `find`

5. **Manual File List for Find/Replace**
   - **Problem**: Misses files in unexpected locations. Partial updates.
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive `grep -rl` to find ALL files first

6. **Forward Slash Delimiter in Sed for Paths**
   - **Problem**: Requires escaping every `/`. Unreadable and error-prone.
   - **Solution**: Use `|` or `:` delimiter: `sed 's|old/path|new/path|g'`

### ⚠️ Medium Priority Anti-Patterns

7. **Platform-Specific Sed Syntax**
   - **Problem**: Works on macOS, fails on Linux (or vice-versa)
   - **Solution**: Use `-i.bak` (portable) or detect OS

8. **Forgetting Reference Updates After Moves**
   - **Problem**: Documentation points to non-existent paths
   - **Solution**: Grep for old path, update ALL references

9. **Leaving Backup Files in Repository**
   - **Problem**: `.bak` files clutter git status, might be committed
   - **Solution**: Add `*.bak` to .gitignore, clean up after validation

---

## Success Metrics

**Pass Criteria** (All must be met):
1. ✅ Single consolidated directory: `prps/execution_reliability/`
2. ✅ PRP file renamed with no redundant prefix
3. ✅ Zero instances of old naming in documentation
4. ✅ Test script relocated from root
5. ✅ Template locations documented clearly
6. ✅ Git history preserved for all file operations
7. ✅ All validation gates pass

**Impact Metrics**:
- Files moved: 12 (in 3 directories)
- Files renamed: 1 (PRP file)
- Files updated: 10+ (documentation references)
- Files created: 1 (template README.md)
- Directories deleted: 1 (after validation)
- Git commits: 2-3 (renames separate from content changes)

**Quality Indicators**:
- `grep -r "execution_reliability" prps/` returns 0 results
- `git log --follow prps/execution_reliability.md` shows full history
- `git status` shows "renamed:" not "deleted + added"
- All documentation file paths resolve correctly

---

## PRP Quality Self-Assessment

**Score: 9/10** - High confidence in one-pass implementation success

**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Comprehensive context**: All 5 research docs thorough and complete
  - feature-analysis.md: 630 lines, 10 assumptions documented
  - codebase-patterns.md: 1,313 lines, 5 architectural patterns
  - documentation-links.md: 740 lines, 8 official sources
  - examples-to-include.md: 436 lines, 4 runnable code examples (~1,200 lines total)
  - gotchas.md: 1,405 lines, 12 comprehensive gotchas with solutions

- ✅ **Clear task breakdown**: 10 tasks with specific steps, validation gates, and patterns
  - Each task has: FILES, PATTERN, STEPS, VALIDATION
  - Dependencies clearly marked (Task 2 before Task 3, etc.)
  - Phased approach with validation after each task

- ✅ **Proven patterns**: 4 working code examples extracted
  - git_mv_operations.sh: 290 lines
  - multi_file_find_replace.py: 370 lines
  - validation_checks.sh: 290 lines
  - directory_tree_visualization.py: 260 lines
  - All tested and runnable

- ✅ **Validation strategy**: Multi-level validation gates
  - Pre-flight validation (before operations)
  - Post-operation validation (after each task)
  - Git history validation (rename detection)
  - File accessibility test (spot checks)
  - Final comprehensive checklist

- ✅ **Error handling**: 12 gotchas documented with solutions
  - 8 critical/high severity gotchas
  - 4 medium severity gotchas
  - Each has: detection method, anti-pattern, solution, verification

**Deduction (-1 point) reasoning**:
- **No existing similar cleanup in codebase**: This is a novel cleanup pattern. No directly comparable PRPs in Archon or local codebase to validate approach against.
  - Mitigation: Based approach on git best practices and official documentation
  - Mitigation: Created 4 comprehensive code examples to guide implementation

**Strengths**:
- Surgical, well-defined scope (8 specific tasks, no feature development)
- Precedent-setting work (establishes "no redundant prefixes" convention)
- Novel pattern creation (4 reusable code examples for future cleanups)
- Comprehensive gotcha coverage (git history loss, TOCTOU, partial updates)
- Multi-level validation (4 validation gates with clear pass/fail criteria)

**Potential Risks** (mitigated):
- ❌ Risk: Git history loss from improper renames
  - ✅ Mitigation: Gotcha #1 documents exact pattern, separate commits enforced
- ❌ Risk: Partial find/replace missing files
  - ✅ Mitigation: Gotcha #4 + comprehensive grep pattern in Tasks 4-5
- ❌ Risk: Data loss from directory deletion
  - ✅ Mitigation: Gotcha #3 + safe deletion pattern in Task 8 (find + rmdir)

**Ready for execution**: YES - Comprehensive context, clear steps, proven patterns, extensive validation.
