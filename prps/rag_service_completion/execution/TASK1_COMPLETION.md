# Task 1 Implementation Complete: Service Naming Consistency

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: N/A
- **Task Name**: Task 1: Service Naming Consistency
- **Responsibility**: Rename 'api' service to 'backend' in docker-compose.yml for consistency
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
None

### Modified Files:
1. **/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/docker-compose.yml**
   - Updated header comment service list from `api` to `backend` (line 7)
   - Updated usage example from `logs -f api` to `logs -f backend` (line 13)
   - Changed service name from `api` to `backend` (line 64)
   - Updated container_name from `rag-api` to `rag-service-backend` (line 68)
   - Updated frontend dependency reference from `api` to `backend` (line 132)

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Service Name Update
- Renamed the FastAPI service from `api` to `backend` for consistency with project naming conventions
- Aligns with the pattern where backend services are explicitly named "backend"

#### 2. Container Name Update
- Changed container_name from `rag-api` to `rag-service-backend`
- Follows the pattern: `{service_name}-{component_type}`
- Provides clear identification in docker ps output

#### 3. Dependency Reference Update
- Updated frontend service's `depends_on` section
- Changed from `api: condition: service_healthy` to `backend: condition: service_healthy`
- Ensures proper service startup ordering

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### No Critical Gotchas for This Task
This is a simple find-replace operation with minimal risk. The key considerations were:

1. **Complete Reference Updates**: Ensured all references to the old service name were updated
   - Service definition (line 64)
   - Container name (line 68)
   - Frontend dependency (line 132)

2. **No Network Changes**: Internal network references remain the same (service discovery uses service names)

3. **Health Check Preservation**: Health check remains unchanged since it tests localhost:8001 internally

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
None - This is Task 1, no dependencies

### External Dependencies:
None - Pure configuration change

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Services Restarted):
- [ ] Run `docker-compose config` to validate configuration (PASSED)
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up -d` to start services with new name
- [ ] Verify backend service starts with container name `rag-service-backend`
- [ ] Verify frontend service starts and connects to backend
- [ ] Verify health check at http://localhost:8002/health still works
- [ ] Run `docker-compose ps` to confirm service names display correctly

### Validation Results:

**Configuration Validation**: PASSED
```bash
docker-compose config
```
Output: Configuration parsed successfully with:
- Service name: `backend`
- Container name: `rag-service-backend`
- Frontend dependency: `backend` (condition: service_healthy)
- No validation errors or warnings (except obsolete version attribute warning)

**Key Observations**:
1. Service renamed successfully: `api` → `backend`
2. Container name updated: `rag-api` → `rag-service-backend`
3. Frontend dependency updated correctly
4. Health checks preserved
5. All environment variables intact
6. Network configuration unchanged

## Success Metrics

**All PRP Requirements Met**:
- [x] Change service name from 'api' to 'backend'
- [x] Update container_name from 'rag-service-api' to 'rag-service-backend'
- [x] Update health check references if any (none needed - uses localhost)
- [x] Update any internal network references (frontend dependency updated)

**Code Quality**:
- Clear, minimal changes
- All references updated completely
- No breaking changes to service functionality
- Configuration validates successfully

## Completion Report

**Implementation Notes**:

This task was a straightforward find-replace operation with five specific changes:

1. **Header Comment - Service List** (line 7): `- api:` → `- backend:`
2. **Header Comment - Usage Example** (line 13): `logs -f api` → `logs -f backend`
3. **Service Definition** (line 64): `api:` → `backend:`
4. **Container Name** (line 68): `rag-api` → `rag-service-backend`
5. **Frontend Dependency** (line 132): `api:` → `backend:`

No additional changes were needed because:
- Health checks use localhost internally (no service name references)
- Network communication uses service discovery (docker-compose handles this)
- Environment variables don't reference service names
- Port mappings remain unchanged

**Validation**:
The `docker-compose config` command successfully validated the configuration with no errors. The service can now be referenced as `backend` throughout the stack, providing consistency with other services in the codebase.

**Next Steps**:
- When services are restarted, verify container name appears as `rag-service-backend`
- Update any external documentation referencing the old `api` service name
- Task 2 (MCP Server Migration) can proceed with the new service naming

**Ready for integration and next steps.**
