## Example 1: Validation Report Template

**File**: `template_validation_report.md`
**Source**: `.claude/templates/validation-report.md`
**Relevance**: 10/10

### What to Mimic

- **Multi-level validation structure**: Level 1 (Syntax), Level 2 (Unit), Level 3 (Integration)
  ```markdown
  ### Level 1: Syntax & Style Checks
  **Status**: {✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL}
  **Commands Run**: ...
  **Results**: ...
  ```

- **Iteration tracking table**: Shows fix attempts across validation runs
  ```markdown
  | Attempt | Level | Result | Duration | Issues Fixed |
  |---------|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
  | 1 | Level 1 | ❌ FAIL | 2min | Syntax errors in file.py |
  | 2 | Level 1 | ✅ PASS | 1min | - |
  ```

- **Issue detail section**: Structured problem documentation
  ```markdown
  ### Issue #1: {Issue Title}
  - **Severity**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
  - **Location**: {file:line}
  - **Fix Applied**: {what was done}
  ```

- **Summary metrics at top**: Quick status overview
  ```markdown
  **Overall Status**: {✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL}
  **Total Levels**: {X}
  **Levels Passed**: {Y}
  ```

### What to Adapt

- **Variable placeholders**: Replace `{Feature Name}` with actual feature name using template substitution
- **Command specifics**: Adapt `ruff check --fix .` to project-specific linting tools
- **Validation levels**: Add/remove levels based on PRP requirements (e.g., add Level 4 for deployment validation)
- **Issue categories**: Customize severity levels and fields based on project needs

### What to Skip

- None - this is a complete, production-ready template
- All sections are essential for comprehensive validation reporting

### Pattern Highlights

```markdown
# KEY PATTERN: Status-first reporting

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASS
**Total Levels**: 3
**Levels Passed**: 3
**Issues Found**: 0

# This structure enables:
# 1. Quick status check (don't read whole report if all passed)
# 2. Executive summary (for stakeholders)
# 3. Audit trail (shows iteration count)
```

**Why this works**:
- Status emoji (✅/❌) gives instant visual feedback
- Metrics quantify quality (3/3 levels passed)
- Iteration table shows effort (how many fix attempts)

### Why This Example

This template is the **reference implementation** for validation reporting. It's already used in task_management_ui PRP and has proven effective for:
- Documenting validation attempts (critical for 48% → 100% coverage goal)
- Showing fix iterations (transparency in validation process)
- Providing actionable next steps (what to do if validation fails)

Use this as the basis for the **enhanced validation-report.md** template.

---

## Example 2: Generic Completion Report Template

**File**: `template_completion_report.md`
**Source**: `.claude/templates/completion-report.md`
**Relevance**: 8/10

### What to Mimic

- **Performance metrics table**: Quantified success criteria
  ```markdown
  | Metric | Value | Target | Status |
  |--------|-------|--------|--------|
  | Phase 2 Duration | {X} min | < 7 min | {✅/❌} |
  | Parallel Speedup | {Y}% | > 50% | {✅/❌} |
  ```

- **Timing breakdown**: Shows where time was spent
  ```markdown
  - Phase 0 (Setup): {X} min
  - Phase 1 (Analysis): {Y} min
  - Phase 2 (Parallel): {Z} min ⚡
  ```

### What to Adapt

- **Task-specific sections**: This is generic (for PRP generation/execution overall)
  - For task completion reports, add: Files Modified, Dependencies, Gotchas Addressed
  - For test reports, add: Test Count, Coverage %, Patterns Used

- **Metrics**: Customize based on what's measurable
  - Task reports: Implementation Time, Files Changed, LOC
  - Test reports: Coverage %, Test Count, Assertions
  - Validation reports: Levels Passed, Issues Fixed, Iterations

### What to Skip

- Don't use this template as-is for task completion reports
- It's too generic - lacks file tracking, dependency verification, gotcha addressing

### Pattern Highlights

```markdown
# KEY PATTERN: Metrics-first reporting

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Time | 45 min | < 60 min | ✅ |

# This pattern:
# 1. Defines success criteria (targets)
# 2. Measures outcomes (values)
# 3. Shows pass/fail (status)
# 4. Enables trend analysis (track over time)
```

### Why This Example

Shows the **metrics-driven approach** to reporting. While too generic for task completion, it demonstrates:
- How to quantify success (not just "done" but "done in X time with Y quality")
- How to structure performance data (tables are scannable)
- How to include timing breakdowns (identify bottlenecks)

Use the **metrics pattern** but enhance with task-specific sections.

## Example 3: Exemplary Task Completion Report

**File**: `example_task_completion_report.md`
**Source**: `prps/task_management_ui/execution/TASK_17_COMPLETION.md`
**Relevance**: 10/10 - **BEST PRACTICE**

### What to Mimic

This is the **gold standard** for task completion reports. Mimic ALL of these sections:

- **Task Information header**: Clear identification
  ```markdown
  - **Task ID**: 8a136a74-32d6-4b2f-bee8-49e662ac47e8 (Archon)
  - **Task Name**: Task 17: Frontend - List View
  - **Responsibility**: Filterable table view with sorting
  - **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review
  ```

- **Files Created/Modified with details**: Not just paths, but what each file does
  ```markdown
  ### Created Files:
  1. **`/path/to/TaskListView.tsx`** (452 lines)
     - Main table component with filtering, sorting, and pagination
     - URL-based state management
     - Debounced filter changes (300ms)
  ```

- **Implementation Details with subsections**: Break down by feature area
  ```markdown
  ### Core Features Implemented ✅
  #### 1. Filter Controls
  - **Status filter**: Dropdown with all 4 statuses
  - **URL-based state**: All filters stored in query params
  ```

- **Critical Gotchas Addressed**: Show PRP gotchas were followed
  ```markdown
  #### Gotcha #1: URL Query Params (PRP Requirement)
  **Requirement**: Use URL query params for filters
  **Implementation**: [code snippet]
  **Benefits**: Shareable URLs, browser navigation works
  ```

- **Dependencies Verified**: Show what was checked
  ```markdown
  ### Completed Dependencies:
  - ✅ **Task 13 (useProjectTasks)**: Hook exists and works correctly

  ### External Dependencies:
  - ⚠️ **react-router-dom**: Required, needs to be installed
  ```

- **Testing Checklist**: Manual validation steps
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Navigate to `/projects/:projectId/list`
  - [ ] Verify table displays tasks
  - [ ] Filter by status (URL updates)
  ```

- **Success Metrics**: PRP requirement checklist
  ```markdown
  ✅ **All PRP Requirements Met**:
  - [x] Create TaskListView component
  - [x] Use useProjectTasks(projectId) to fetch tasks
  - [x] Add filter controls
  ```

- **Completion Report summary**: Quick stats
  ```markdown
  **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Review
  **Implementation Time**: ~35 minutes
  **Confidence Level**: HIGH
  **Blockers**: None

  ### Files Created: 5
  ### Files Modified: 1
  ### Total Lines of Code: ~912 lines
  ```

### What to Adapt

- **Paths**: Use absolute paths from your project (not hardcoded `/Users/jon/...`)
- **Task-specific features**: Replace "Filter Controls" with your task's feature areas
- **Testing checklist**: Customize based on task requirements
- **Dependencies**: List actual dependencies for your task

### What to Skip

- None - this is comprehensive
- All sections provide value for auditability and learning

### Pattern Highlights

```markdown
# KEY PATTERN 1: Gotcha verification with code snippets

#### Gotcha #1: URL Query Params (PRP Requirement)
**Requirement**: Use URL query params for filters (not local state)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();
const statusFilter = searchParams.get("status") as TaskStatus | null;
```

**Benefits**:
- Shareable URLs with filters applied
- Browser back/forward navigation works

# This pattern:
# 1. References PRP gotcha explicitly
# 2. Shows actual implementation (proof it was followed)
# 3. Explains benefits (why this approach matters)
```

```markdown
# KEY PATTERN 2: Dependency verification

### Completed Dependencies:
- ✅ **Task 13 (useProjectTasks)**: Hook exists and works correctly

### External Dependencies:
- ⚠️ **react-router-dom**: Required, needs to be installed

# This pattern:
# 1. Separates internal (other tasks) from external (npm packages)
# 2. Shows verification status (✅ checked, ⚠️ needs action)
# 3. Provides context (what dependency does, why it's needed)
```

### Why This Example

This is the **reference implementation** for task completion reports because:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects (files, features, gotchas, dependencies, testing)
- **Actionable**: Includes testing checklist for validation
- **Auditable**: Clear trail of what was implemented and why
- **Educational**: Shows implementation decisions with code snippets

**This is what 100% report coverage looks like.** Use this structure for the new **task-completion-report.md** template.

---

## Example 4: Validation Gate Pattern (Python)

**File**: `validation_gate_pattern.py`
**Source**: `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` + `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md`
**Relevance**: 10/10

### What to Mimic

- **PATTERN 1: Security validation** - Use for ALL user-provided paths
  ```python
  def extract_feature_name(filepath: str, strip_prefix: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
      # Check 1: Path traversal detection
      if ".." in filepath:
          raise ValueError(f"Path traversal detected: {filepath}")

      # Check 2: Valid characters only
      if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', feature):
          raise ValueError(f"Invalid characters: {feature}")

      # Check 3: Length validation
      # Check 4: Shell injection prevention
  ```
  **Why**: Prevents security vulnerabilities in file paths

- **PATTERN 2: Report existence validation** - The core validation gate
  ```python
  def validate_report_exists(feature_name: str, task_number: int) -> bool:
      report_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK{task_number}_COMPLETION.md"

      if not Path(report_path).exists():
          raise ValidationError(actionable_error_message)

      return True
  ```
  **Why**: This is the CRITICAL gate that prevents 48% → 100% coverage

- **PATTERN 3: Report section validation** - Check content quality
  ```python
  def validate_report_sections(report_path: str, required_sections: List[str]) -> List[str]:
      with open(report_path, 'r') as f:
          report_content = f.read()

      missing_sections = []
      for section in required_sections:
          if f"## {section}" not in report_content:
              missing_sections.append(section)

      return missing_sections
  ```
  **Why**: Ensures reports have minimum required content (not just empty files)

- **PATTERN 4: Validation loop with fixes** - Iterative validation
  ```python
  MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5

  for attempt in range(1, MAX_ATTEMPTS + 1):
      result = run_validation_command(validation_command)

      if result['success']:
          print(f"✅ {level_name} passed")
          break

      if attempt < MAX_ATTEMPTS:
          error_analysis = error_analyzer(result['error'])
          apply_fix(error_analysis['suggested_fix'])
  ```
  **Why**: Automates fix attempts (from quality-gates.md pattern)

- **PATTERN 5: Report coverage calculation** - Metrics for summary
  ```python
  def calculate_report_coverage(feature_name: str, total_tasks: int) -> dict:
      task_reports = glob(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK*_COMPLETION.md")
      reports_found = len(task_reports)
      coverage_pct = (reports_found / total_tasks) * 100

      # Find missing task numbers
      missing_tasks = sorted(all_tasks - reported_tasks)

      return {
          "total_tasks": total_tasks,
          "reports_found": reports_found,
          "coverage_percentage": coverage_pct,
          "missing_tasks": missing_tasks
      }
  ```
  **Why**: Enables "Reports: 25/25 (100%)" summary display

### What to Adapt

- **File paths**: Change `prps/{feature_name}/execution/` if directory structure differs
- **Naming convention**: Adapt `TASK{n}_COMPLETION.md` pattern if using different format
- **Required sections**: Customize based on what sections are mandatory
  ```python
  required_sections = [
      "Implementation Summary",
      "Files Created/Modified",
      "Validation"
  ]
  ```
- **Validation commands**: Replace `ruff check` with project-specific tools

### What to Skip

- Don't skip security validation (PATTERN 1) - critical for safety
- Don't skip report existence check (PATTERN 2) - this is the core gate
- You CAN skip section validation (PATTERN 3) if reports are auto-generated from template

### Pattern Highlights

```python
# KEY PATTERN: Actionable error messages

if not Path(report_path).exists():
    error_msg = f"""
❌ VALIDATION GATE FAILED: Missing Task Report

Task {task_number} did not generate required completion report.

Expected Path: {report_path}

Troubleshooting:
1. Check if task subagent finished execution
2. Verify template was loaded
3. Check write permissions

Resolution:
- Re-run task {task_number} with explicit report requirement
- OR manually create report

DO NOT CONTINUE without resolving this issue.
"""
    raise ValidationError(error_msg)

# This error message:
# 1. States problem clearly (missing report)
# 2. Shows expected path (where to look)
# 3. Provides troubleshooting steps (how to investigate)
# 4. Suggests resolutions (how to fix)
# 5. Emphasizes criticality (DO NOT CONTINUE)
```

### Why This Example

This file contains **ALL the validation logic patterns** needed for PRP execution reliability:
- Security validation (prevents vulnerabilities)
- Report existence check (core validation gate)
- Section validation (quality check)
- Validation loops (automated fixing)
- Coverage calculation (metrics)

**These are the building blocks** for implementing mandatory reporting. Copy these functions into execute-prp.md workflow.

## Example 5: Error Message Pattern (Python)

**File**: `error_message_pattern.py`
**Source**: `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` + `.claude/patterns/quality-gates.md`
**Relevance**: 9/10

### What to Mimic

- **Structured error format**: Problem → Context → Impact → Troubleshooting → Resolution
  ```python
  def format_missing_report_error(task_number: int, feature_name: str) -> str:
      return f"""
  {'='*80}
  ❌ VALIDATION GATE FAILED: Missing Task Report
  {'='*80}

  PROBLEM:
  Task {task_number} did not generate required completion report.

  EXPECTED PATH:
  {report_path}

  IMPACT:
  This task is INCOMPLETE without documentation.
  - Cannot audit what was implemented
  - Cannot learn from implementation decisions

  TROUBLESHOOTING:
  1. Check if task subagent finished execution
  2. Verify template exists
  3. Check file system permissions

  RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
  Option 1: Re-run task with explicit report requirement
  Option 2: Manually create report (not recommended)
  Option 3: Debug subagent execution

  DO NOT CONTINUE without resolving this issue.
  {'='*80}
  """
  ```

- **Visual hierarchy**: Use separators, emojis, sections
  ```python
  # Separator lines for visual clarity
  {'='*80}

  # Emojis for quick status
  ❌ VALIDATION GATE FAILED
  ✅ COMPLETE
  ⚠️ WARNING
  ```

- **Multiple resolution options**: Give user choices
  ```python
  RESOLUTION OPTIONS:

  Option 1: Re-run task (recommended)
  Option 2: Manual creation (fallback)
  Option 3: Debug (investigation)
  ```

- **Report coverage summary**: Clear metrics display
  ```python
  def format_report_coverage_summary(total_tasks, reports_found, coverage_pct, missing_tasks):
      status_emoji = "✅" if coverage_pct == 100 else "⚠️"

      return f"""
  {status_emoji} REPORT COVERAGE: {status_text}

  METRICS:
  - Total Tasks: {total_tasks}
  - Reports Found: {reports_found}
  - Coverage: {coverage_pct:.1f}%

  MISSING REPORTS:
  Tasks without completion reports: {', '.join(map(str, missing_tasks))}
  """
  ```

### What to Adapt

- **Tone**: Adjust formality based on audience (internal team vs external users)
- **Detail level**: More/less troubleshooting based on user expertise
- **Resolution options**: Customize based on available actions
- **Paths**: Use actual project paths instead of examples

### What to Skip

- Don't skip the structured format - it's critical for self-service debugging
- Don't skip troubleshooting steps - they reduce support burden
- You CAN simplify for non-critical warnings (but keep for errors)

### Pattern Highlights

```python
# KEY PATTERN: Self-service error messages

# INSTEAD OF:
"Error: Report missing"

# DO THIS:
"""
❌ VALIDATION GATE FAILED: Missing Task Report

PROBLEM: [What went wrong]
EXPECTED PATH: [Where to look]
IMPACT: [Why it matters]

TROUBLESHOOTING: [How to investigate]
1. Check X
2. Verify Y
3. Review Z

RESOLUTION: [How to fix]
Option 1: [Recommended approach]
Option 2: [Alternative]
"""

# This format:
# 1. Enables self-service (user can fix without asking)
# 2. Reduces back-and-forth (all info in one message)
# 3. Shows severity (emoji + header)
# 4. Provides learning (explains why error happened)
```

### Why This Example

Error messages are the **primary user interface** during validation failures. Good error messages:
- Reduce debugging time (clear troubleshooting steps)
- Enable self-service (don't need to ask for help)
- Improve reliability (users fix issues correctly)

**These patterns ensure validation gates are helpful, not frustrating.**

---

## Usage Instructions

### Study Phase

1. **Read each example file in order**:
   - Start with templates (understand structure)
   - Study validation patterns (understand logic)
   - Review error messages (understand UX)

2. **Understand the attribution headers** in each file:
   ```markdown
   # Source: .claude/templates/validation-report.md
   # Pattern: Validation report template with quality gates
   # Relevance: 10/10
   ```
   This tells you:
   - Where the code came from (source)
   - What pattern it demonstrates
   - How relevant it is (10/10 = critical)

3. **Focus on "What to Mimic" sections** in this README:
   - These are the KEY patterns to copy
   - Code snippets show exact implementation
   - Explanations tell you WHY each pattern works

4. **Note "What to Adapt" sections**:
   - These are customization points
   - Variables, paths, commands that need project-specific values
   - Don't copy blindly - adapt to your context

### Application Phase

1. **Copy patterns from examples**:
   ```python
   # From validation_gate_pattern.py
   def validate_report_exists(feature_name: str, task_number: int) -> bool:
       report_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK{task_number}_COMPLETION.md"
       if not Path(report_path).exists():
           raise ValidationError(actionable_error_message)
       return True
   ```

2. **Adapt variable names and logic**:
   ```python
   # Adapt for your feature
   def validate_report_exists(feature_name: str, task_number: int, report_type: str = "COMPLETION"):
       report_path = f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK{task_number}_{report_type}.md"
       # ... rest of logic
   ```

3. **Skip irrelevant sections**:
   - If you don't need section validation, skip PATTERN 3
   - If you don't have Archon IDs, skip that field from task reports

4. **Combine multiple patterns if needed**:
   ```python
   # Combine security validation + report existence check
   feature_name = extract_feature_name(prp_path, "INITIAL_")  # PATTERN 1
   validate_report_exists(feature_name, task_number)          # PATTERN 2
   ```

### Testing Patterns

**Test Pattern 1: Report Existence Validation**
```python
# Setup
feature_name = "test_feature"
task_number = 1

# Test 1: Report exists
Path(f"prps/{feature_name}/execution/TASK1_COMPLETION.md").touch()
assert validate_report_exists(feature_name, 1) == True

# Test 2: Report missing
try:
    validate_report_exists(feature_name, 2)
    assert False, "Should have raised ValidationError"
except ValidationError as e:
    assert "Missing Task Report" in str(e)
```

**Test Pattern 2: Report Coverage Calculation**
```python
# Setup: Create some reports
Path("prps/test_feature/execution/TASK1_COMPLETION.md").touch()
Path("prps/test_feature/execution/TASK3_COMPLETION.md").touch()

# Calculate coverage
metrics = calculate_report_coverage("test_feature", total_tasks=5)

# Verify
assert metrics['reports_found'] == 2
assert metrics['coverage_percentage'] == 40.0
assert metrics['missing_tasks'] == [2, 4, 5]
```

## Integration with PRP

These examples should be:

1. **Referenced** in PRP "All Needed Context" section:
   ```markdown
   ## All Needed Context

   ### Code Examples
   - prps/prp_execution_reliability/examples/validation_gate_pattern.py (validation logic)
   - prps/prp_execution_reliability/examples/error_message_pattern.py (error messages)
   - prps/prp_execution_reliability/examples/example_task_completion_report.md (report structure)
   ```

2. **Studied** before implementation:
   - Read all examples in study phase
   - Understand patterns before coding
   - Adapt patterns during implementation

3. **Adapted** for the specific feature needs:
   - Copy validation gate functions into execute-prp.md
   - Enhance templates based on example_task_completion_report.md
   - Use error message patterns for actionable feedback

4. **Extended** if additional patterns emerge:
   - Add new examples if better patterns discovered
   - Update README with new "What to Mimic" sections
   - Keep examples directory as living documentation

---

## Pattern Summary

### Common Patterns Across Examples

1. **Status-first reporting**: Always show status at the top (✅/❌/⚠️)
   - Appears in: validation_report, completion_report, task_completion_report
   - Why: Quick scan without reading full report

2. **Structured sections**: Consistent markdown headers (##, ###)
   - Appears in: All markdown templates
   - Why: Enables section validation, improves readability

3. **Actionable errors**: Problem → Context → Impact → Troubleshooting → Resolution
   - Appears in: validation_gate_pattern.py, error_message_pattern.py
   - Why: Self-service debugging, reduced support burden

4. **Metrics tables**: Quantified outcomes with targets
   - Appears in: completion_report, task_completion_report
   - Why: Objective success measurement, trend analysis

5. **Gotcha verification**: Show PRP gotchas were addressed
   - Appears in: task_completion_report
   - Why: Proves requirements followed, educates implementers

### Anti-Patterns Observed (What NOT to do)

1. **Missing reports** (48% coverage in task_management_ui):
   - Problem: No validation gate caught missing reports
   - Solution: validate_report_exists() function (PATTERN 2)

2. **Inconsistent naming** (6 different patterns found):
   - Problem: TASK_17_VALIDATION.md vs TASK17_COMPLETION.md vs TASK5_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md
   - Solution: Standardize on TASK{n}_COMPLETION.md

3. **Generic error messages**:
   - Problem: "Error: File not found" (not actionable)
   - Solution: format_missing_report_error() with troubleshooting steps

4. **Silent failures**:
   - Problem: Execution continues despite missing reports
   - Solution: raise ValidationError (fail fast)
