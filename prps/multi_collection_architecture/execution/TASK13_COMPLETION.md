- **Task Name**: Task 13: Update Documentation
- **Responsibility**: Document the multi-collection architecture decision and implementation in TODO.md
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for Review

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
None - This task only modified existing documentation.

### Modified Files:
1. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/TODO.md`**
   - Updated: "Architecture Decision" section (lines 14-37) - Documented multi-collection approach with rationale
   - Added: Architecture Decisions subsection (lines 103-121) - Technical details of multi-collection implementation
   - Expanded: Critical Gotchas section (lines 123-153) - Added 4 new content classification gotchas
   - Updated: Database Schema documentation (lines 164-179) - Added enabled_collections field and collection routing
   - Updated: System Health section (lines 76-104) - Added collection information and multi-collection features
   - Updated: Last Updated timestamp (line 266) - Marked as multi-collection architecture documented

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Architecture Decision Documentation
- Documented multi-collection approach as IMPLEMENTED (no longer a decision to be made)
- Included implementation date (2025-10-16) and PRP reference
- Explained three specialized collections: AI_DOCUMENTS, AI_CODE, AI_MEDIA
- Documented user control via enabled_collections field
- Explained content classification routing

#### 2. Rationale Section
- **Better Embeddings**: Code uses text-embedding-3-large (3072d), docs use text-embedding-3-small (1536d)
- **User Control**: Explicit opt-in prevents unexpected behavior and controls costs
- **Scalability**: Per-collection HNSW indices perform better than single massive index
- **Domain Isolation**: Different content types physically separated in vector space
- **Flexibility**: Cross-collection search enabled by default

#### 3. Implementation Details
- Database: enabled_collections TEXT[] field (Migration 003)
- Collections: AI_DOCUMENTS (1536d), AI_CODE (3072d), AI_MEDIA (512d, future)
- Classification: 40% code indicator threshold (lenient)
- Models: text-embedding-3-small vs text-embedding-3-large
- Status Change: Removed "pending" status, sources default to "active"

#### 4. Content Classification Gotchas
- **Gotcha #18**: CODE_DETECTION_THRESHOLD tuning guidance
- **Gotcha #19**: Media collection currently disabled (future feature)
- **Gotcha #20**: Content classifier uses multiple indicators (not just syntax)
- **Gotcha #21**: enabled_collections filters chunks during ingestion (cost management)

#### 5. System Health Updates
- Added multi-collection features to "Working Features" list
- Documented active Qdrant collections with dimensions and purposes
- Updated current data section with collection distribution info
- Noted Migration 003 applied to sources

#### 6. Database Schema Updates
- Added enabled_collections[] field to sources table documentation
- Documented status enum change (removed "pending"/"completed")
- Added vector distribution across AI_DOCUMENTS, AI_CODE, AI_MEDIA
- Documented constraints and GIN index

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### From PRP Lines 118-129:
All critical gotchas from the PRP were incorporated into the documentation:

1. **VectorService Collection Names** (Gotcha #15)
   - Documented: Qdrant collection names are case-sensitive
   - Example: "AI_DOCUMENTS" != "ai_documents"

2. **Collection Dimensions** (Gotcha #16)
   - Documented: Each collection needs correct dimension in VectorParams
   - Specified: 1536 for documents, 3072 for code

3. **Collection Initialization** (Gotcha #17)
   - Documented: Qdrant collections must be created before first upsert
   - Reference: Use qdrant_init.py on startup

4. **Content Type Detection Threshold** (Gotcha #18)
   - Documented: 40% threshold may need tuning per domain
   - Guidance: Too low = false positives, too high = missed code

5. **Media Collection Status** (Gotcha #19)
   - Documented: Media collection currently disabled (future feature)
   - Note: Media chunks routed to documents collection until CLIP implemented

6. **Content Classifier Behavior** (Gotcha #20)
   - Documented: Uses multiple indicators (3+ OR 40%+ density)
   - Defaults to "documents" when ambiguous

7. **Chunk Filtering** (Gotcha #21)
   - Documented: enabled_collections filters chunks during ingestion
   - Explained: Intentional for cost management and user control
