## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Multi-Collection Determination Logic
- **If source_id filter provided**: Query database for `source.enabled_collections` for that specific source
- **If no source_id filter**: Search all collections (documents, code, media)
- **Graceful handling**: Returns empty list if source has zero enabled collections
- **Legacy fallback**: If db_pool not provided, fallback to single-collection behavior

#### 2. Query Embedding Generation
- Generate query embedding **once** using "documents" model (text-embedding-3-small)
- Embedding is reused across all collection searches (efficient)
- Cache lookup for performance (<1ms on cache hit)

#### 3. Per-Collection Search
- For each collection to search:
  - Create VectorService instance with collection-specific name (AI_DOCUMENTS, AI_CODE, AI_MEDIA)
  - Apply source_id filter if specified (only search sources with collection enabled)
  - Verify source has this collection enabled via database query
  - Search collection with threshold filtering (>= 0.05)
  - Add `collection_type` metadata to each result

#### 4. Result Aggregation and Re-Ranking
- Collect results from all searched collections
- Sort by score descending (highest similarity first)
- Return top N results across all collections
- Include collection_type in result metadata for transparency

#### 5. Performance Optimization
- Retrieve `limit * 2` results per collection for better re-ranking
- Single embedding generation (not per-collection)
- Parallel-ready architecture (can be parallelized in future)
- Performance targets: <50ms p95 (single collection), <150ms p95 (multi-collection)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #1: Sources with Zero Enabled Collections
**Problem**: Source might have `enabled_collections = []` after migration or misconfiguration
**Implementation**: `_determine_collections_to_search()` returns empty list, search returns gracefully with no results
```python
if not collections_to_search:
    logger.warning("No collections to search (sources have zero enabled collections)")
    return []
```

#### Gotcha #2: Collection Not Enabled for Source
**Problem**: User filters by source_id but source doesn't have collection X enabled
**Implementation**: `_search_collection()` verifies source has collection enabled via DB query, skips if not
```python
row = await conn.fetchrow(
    """
    SELECT id FROM sources
    WHERE id = $1
    AND $2 = ANY(enabled_collections)
    """,
    source_id,
    collection_type
)
if not row:
    return []  # Skip this collection
```

#### Gotcha #3: Legacy Backward Compatibility
**Problem**: Existing code might not pass db_pool/qdrant_client
**Implementation**: Constructor parameters are optional, fallback to legacy single-collection behavior
```python
if self.db_pool is None:
    logger.debug("Multi-collection disabled, using legacy single collection")
    # Extract from legacy vector_service.collection_name
    return [collection_type]
```

#### Gotcha #4: Query Embedding Model Selection
**Problem**: Different collections use different embedding models, which model for query?
**Implementation**: Use "documents" model (text-embedding-3-small) for general queries as it's compatible across collections
```python
query_embedding = await self.embedding_service.embed_text(
    query,
    model_name=settings.COLLECTION_EMBEDDING_MODELS.get("documents")
)
```

#### Gotcha #5: Qdrant Filter Syntax
**Problem**: Qdrant requires specific filter structure for source_id matching
**Implementation**: Use correct Qdrant filter format with "must" and "match"
```python
filter_conditions = {
    "must": [
        {
            "key": "source_id",
            "match": {"value": str(source_id)}
        }
    ]
}
```

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- **Task 5: VectorService Multi-Collection Support** ✓
  - Verified: `VectorService.get_collection_name(collection_type)` static method exists
  - Verified: VectorService supports dynamic collection names in constructor
  - Verified: VectorService auto-detects dimensions based on collection name

- **Task 7: Ingestion Multi-Collection Storage** ✓
  - Verified: Ingestion pipeline stores chunks in multiple collections
  - Verified: Database has `enabled_collections` column in sources table
  - Verified: Chunks are tagged with collection_type metadata

### External Dependencies:
- **asyncpg**: Required for database pool queries
- **qdrant_client**: Required for creating collection-specific VectorService instances
- **settings.COLLECTION_EMBEDDING_MODELS**: Configuration for model selection
- **settings.COLLECTION_NAME_PREFIX**: Collection naming convention (default: "AI_")

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Services Running):
- [ ] Search with source_id filter returns results from enabled collections only
- [ ] Search without source_id filter returns results from all collections
- [ ] Results include `collection_type` field (documents, code, or media)
- [ ] Results are sorted by score descending
- [ ] Source with only "documents" enabled doesn't return "code" results
- [ ] Source with multiple collections enabled returns aggregated results
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<50ms single, <150ms multi-collection)

### Validation Results:
- **Python Syntax Check**: ✓ PASSED (base_search_strategy.py)
- **Python Syntax Check**: ✓ PASSED (search.py)
- **Type Checking**: Skipped (mypy not available, will run in CI)
- **Lint Checking**: Skipped (ruff not available, will run in CI)

### Integration Points Verified:
- **BaseSearchStrategy constructor**: Now accepts db_pool and qdrant_client (optional)
- **search() method signature**: Unchanged (backward compatible)
- **Result format**: Extended with `collection_type` field (additive change)
- **RAGService integration**: No changes required (delegates to BaseSearchStrategy)
- **API route integration**: Updated to pass db_pool and qdrant_client
