### Created Files:
1. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/backend/src/api/routes/health.py`** (93 lines)
   - Health check router with dependency injection
   - PostgreSQL connectivity validation using async with pool.acquire()
   - Qdrant connectivity validation using get_collections()
   - Component-level status reporting
   - Returns 503 on unhealthy, 200 on healthy

### Modified Files:
1. **`/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/backend/src/main.py`**
   - Added: `from src.api.routes import health` import
   - Added: `app.include_router(health.router, tags=["health"])` to register router
   - Removed: Inline health check endpoint (lines 146-184) - replaced with modular router pattern
   - Changed: ~40 lines removed, 5 lines added

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Health Check Router Module
- Created `health.py` following FastAPI endpoint pattern (examples/07_fastapi_endpoint_pattern.py)
- APIRouter with `/health` endpoint
- Dependency injection for db_pool and qdrant_client
- Comprehensive docstrings with usage examples

#### 2. PostgreSQL Health Check
- Uses `get_db_pool` dependency (returns pool, not connection - Gotcha #2)
- Acquires connection using `async with db_pool.acquire() as conn`
- Validates connectivity with `SELECT 1` query
- Captures exceptions and reports component status

#### 3. Qdrant Health Check
- Uses `get_qdrant_client` dependency
- Validates connectivity with `get_collections()` call
- Captures exceptions and reports component status

#### 4. Response Format
- Structured JSON response with `status` and `checks` fields
- Component-level details for debugging
- Returns 200 on healthy, 503 (Service Unavailable) on unhealthy

#### 5. Router Integration
- Registered in main.py with `app.include_router(health.router, tags=["health"])`
- Replaced inline health check with modular pattern
- Follows project structure (routes/ directory organization)

### Critical Gotchas Addressed

#### Gotcha #2: FastAPI Connection Pool Deadlock
**Implementation**: Dependencies return pool, not connection
```python
# Used get_db_pool which returns asyncpg.Pool
async def health_check(
    db_pool: asyncpg.Pool = Depends(get_db_pool),
    ...
):
    # Acquire connection only when needed
    async with db_pool.acquire() as conn:
        await conn.fetchval("SELECT 1")
    # Connection automatically released
```

**Why this matters**: Returning connections from dependencies causes deadlock as connections are held for entire request duration. Returning pool allows services to acquire/release connections as needed.

#### HTTP Status Code Pattern
**Implementation**: Returns 503 (Service Unavailable) on unhealthy, not 500
```python
if health_status["status"] == "unhealthy":
    raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail=health_status)
```

**Why this matters**: 503 indicates temporary unavailability (service may recover), while 500 indicates application error. Load balancers and monitoring tools expect 503 for health checks.

#### Component-Level Status Reporting
**Implementation**: Detailed checks object with per-component status
```python
health_status = {"status": "healthy", "checks": {}}
health_status["checks"]["postgresql"] = "healthy"
health_status["checks"]["qdrant"] = "healthy"
```

**Why this matters**: Enables debugging by identifying which specific component is failing.

## Dependencies Verified

### Completed Dependencies:
- Task 1.5 (Database and Qdrant Setup): VERIFIED
  - `get_db_pool` dependency exists in `src/api/dependencies.py` (line 25)
  - `get_qdrant_client` dependency exists in `src/api/dependencies.py` (line 72)
  - Both dependencies properly initialized in `main.py` lifespan (lines 57-80)
  - `app.state.db_pool` created with asyncpg.create_pool()
  - `app.state.qdrant_client` created with AsyncQdrantClient()

### External Dependencies:
- `fastapi`: Required for APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
- `asyncpg`: Required for Pool type
- `qdrant_client`: Required for AsyncQdrantClient type

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (When Services Running):
- [ ] Start services: `docker-compose up -d` in `/Users/jon/source/vibes/infra/rag-service/`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Verify 200 response when both services healthy
- [ ] Verify JSON structure: `{"status": "healthy", "checks": {"postgresql": "healthy", "qdrant": "healthy"}}`
- [ ] Stop PostgreSQL: `docker-compose stop postgres`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Verify 503 response with unhealthy postgresql status
- [ ] Restart PostgreSQL: `docker-compose start postgres`
- [ ] Stop Qdrant: `docker-compose stop qdrant`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Verify 503 response with unhealthy qdrant status
- [ ] Restart all services: `docker-compose restart`
