# mcp-notebook-server Refactor TODO

## 🎯 REFACTOR GOALS ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ Clean up messy phase-named files (phase1_*.py, phase2_*.py, phase3_*.py)
- ✅ Consolidate directories under src/ (except docs/)
- ✅ Move Docker files to root for convenience
- ✅ Break code into logical ~400-line modules optimized for LLM context
- ✅ Database storage in vault/.notebook/ instead of separate data/ directory
- ✅ Multi-container Docker setup (sqlite, qdrant, mcp-server, future UI)
